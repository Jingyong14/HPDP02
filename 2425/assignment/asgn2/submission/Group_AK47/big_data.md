## Project Overview

This project focuses on efficient handling and analysis of a large-scale synthetic financial transactions dataset designed for fraud detection model development. The dataset, named `Transactions.csv`, contains over 900,000 generated transactions simulating realistic patterns across various merchant categories and geographic regions.

The dataset serves as an ideal testbed for exploring advanced data processing techniques relevant to financial fraud analytics, featuring key variables such as transaction amounts, merchant details, device fingerprints, geographic info, and fraud labels.
