## Project Overview
For this assignment, the chosen dataset is Transactions.csv, a synthetic financial transactions dataset created using Python. The file size is approximately 2.93 GB, containing over 900,000 transaction records with 24 columns covering various data types including string, boolean, and integer fields.

This dataset is designed for developing and testing fraud detection models by simulating realistic financial transaction patterns. It spans multiple merchant categories such as retail (both online and in-store), groceries, dining, travel, entertainment, healthcare, education, and gas. The diversity in transaction types and customer profiles makes it well-suited for exploratory analysis and performance comparison of big data processing techniques.
