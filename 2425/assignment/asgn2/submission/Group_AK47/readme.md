## Objective




## Introduction


## Dataset Description
This dataset simulates realistic financial transaction patterns and was generated using Python code for the purpose of developing and testing fraud detection models. The data was designed to mimic a wide range of transactional scenarios across multiple categories—including retail, grocery, dining, travel, and more—making it ideal for exploring patterns that distinguish legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones.

Financial fraud is an increasingly prevalent issue, with organizations constantly seeking advanced solutions to detect and prevent suspicious activity. Inspired by real-world transaction data, this dataset was synthetically generated to avoid privacy concerns. It includes key features critical to fraud detection, such as transaction amounts, device types, geographic locations, currency, card type, and a "fraud" label indicating whether a transaction is suspicious.
