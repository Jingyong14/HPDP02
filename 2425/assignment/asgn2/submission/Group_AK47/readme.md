## Objective

The objective of this project is to master efficient big data processing on a large-scale financial transactions dataset by utilizing advanced Python libraries such as Pandas, Dask, and Polars. We focus on applying and comparing high-performance strategies—including chunking, sampling, type optimization, and parallel processing—to optimize memory usage, execution time, and analytical capability. This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern data processing frameworks for extracting insights and supporting fraud detection in the financial sector.


## Introduction

In today’s data-driven landscape, organizations must process and analyze ever-growing datasets that surpass the capabilities of traditional data handling tools. This project tackles these challenges by working with a large-scale financial transactions dataset—ideal for exploring big data processing in fraud detection. Using Python and scalable data libraries, we demonstrate real-world strategies to efficiently manage, analyze, and extract insights from massive transaction records, preparing for practical scenarios in financial analytics and security.

## Dataset Description
This dataset simulates realistic financial transaction patterns and was generated using Python code for the purpose of developing and testing fraud detection models. The data was designed to mimic a wide range of transactional scenarios across multiple categories—including retail, grocery, dining, travel, and more—making it ideal for exploring patterns that distinguish legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones.

Financial fraud is an increasingly prevalent issue, with organizations constantly seeking advanced solutions to detect and prevent suspicious activity. Inspired by real-world transaction data, this dataset was synthetically generated to avoid privacy concerns. It includes key features critical to fraud detection, such as transaction amounts, device types, geographic locations, currency, card type, and a "fraud" label indicating whether a transaction is suspicious.
