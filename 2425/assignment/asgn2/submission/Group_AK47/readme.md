## Objective

The objective of this project is to master efficient big data processing on a large-scale financial transactions dataset by utilizing advanced Python libraries such as Pandas, Dask, and Polars. We focus on applying and comparing high-performance strategies—including chunking, sampling, type optimization, and parallel processing—to optimize memory usage, execution time, and analytical capability. This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern data processing frameworks for extracting insights and supporting fraud detection in the financial sector.


## Introduction

In today’s data-driven landscape, organizations must process and analyze ever-growing datasets that surpass the capabilities of traditional data handling tools. This project tackles these challenges by working with a large-scale financial transactions dataset—ideal for exploring big data processing in fraud detection. Using Python and scalable data libraries, we demonstrate real-world strategies to efficiently manage, analyze, and extract insights from massive transaction records, preparing for practical scenarios in financial analytics and security.
