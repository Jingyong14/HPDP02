## Task 1: Dataset Selection

For this assignment, the selected dataset is `spotify_dataset.csv`, sourced from **Kaggle**, titled "500K+ Spotify Songs with Lyrics, Emotions & More". This dataset offers a comprehensive compilation of metadata and lyrical 
content for over **900,000 songs**, including audio features, emotional tagging, and artist information. The file is approximately **1.15 GB**, which satisfies for large-scale data processing tasks under real-world constraints.

The dataset falls within the **Music & Emotion Analytics** domain. It integrates data science with musicology by offering insights into:
- Lyrics and emotional content extracted using fine-tuned NLP models.
- Audio characteristics such as tempo, loudness, and key.
- Genre classification and contextual tags (e.g., party, chill, workout).
