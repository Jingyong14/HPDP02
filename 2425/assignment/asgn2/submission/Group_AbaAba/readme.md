## 🌐 Dataset Description

For this assignment, we utilize the **`spotify_dataset.csv`** dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset, titled:

> **"500K+ Spotify Songs with Lyrics, Emotions & More"**

offers a comprehensive compilation of over **900,000 songs**, encompassing:

- Audio and acoustic features  
- Lyrical content  
- Emotional annotations  
- Artist metadata  

This dataset is approximately **1.15 GB** in size, making it suitable for evaluating the performance of data processing techniques under large-scale, real-world constraints.
