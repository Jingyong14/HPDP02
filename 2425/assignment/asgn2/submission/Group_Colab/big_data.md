<h2>üíΩ Task 1: Dataset Selection</h2>

### üìá 1.1 Dataset Details
The title of the dataset we used is [**üéß 500K+ Spotify Songs with Lyrics,Emotions & More**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devdope/900k-spotify) which is found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This is a large-scale, music dataset with over 500,000 tracks. It includes lyrics, structured metadata, emotion labels, and more than 30 contextual and audio features per song. It was designed with AI applications in mind, particularly those involving music understanding, semantic search, and playlist generation.

### üñ≤Ô∏è 1.2 Features Included
The dataset has a size of **1.36GB** and is featured with **8551443 rows x 39 columns** of data.
The columns included are:

<h2>Task 2: Load and Inspect Data</h2>

<p>In this task, the Spotify dataset was downloaded using KaggleHub in Google Colab, loaded into memory using Pandas, and inspected to understand its structure. Additionally, we performed basic preprocessing by standardizing selected numerical columns for future analysis.</p>

<h3>‚úÖ Summary</h3>

<p>By the end of this task, the Spotify dataset was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚úÖ Successfully retrieved using KaggleHub</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Loaded into memory using Pandas</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Inspected for structural understanding</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Preprocessed with standardized numerical features</li>
</ul>

<p>This forms the baseline for comparing performance with other frameworks like Polars and Dask in later tasks.</p>


<h2>Task 3: Apply Big Data Handling Strategies</h2>

<h2>Task 4: Comparative Analysis</h2>
The raw dataset is loaded using Pandas, Polars, and Dask library in different runs. During the loading process, the performance for each load is calculated and visualized in graphs for comparison. Memory usage is measured in Megabyte (MB) whereas the execution time is measured in seconds (s).
