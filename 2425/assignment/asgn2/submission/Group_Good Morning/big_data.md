## Introduction

In today’s data-driven environment, analysts must process datasets that exceed traditional memory constraints. This project utilizes the 2019 Airline Delays and Cancellations dataset (1.37 GB) from Kaggle to demonstrate scalable data loading and processing. Using Python with Pandas, Dask, and Polars, we apply selective column loading, chunked reading, data‐type optimization, sampling, and parallel execution to handle big data processing. We evaluate each library’s performance by measuring execution time and memory usage, thereby identifying efficient approaches for large‐volume flight analytics.

## Objectives

The objectives of this assignment are:

- To handle data volumes above 700MB.
- To apply big data handling strategies, including chunking, sampling, type optimization, and parallel computing.
- To evaluate and compare the performance between traditional Pandas and optimized data handling methods in Pandas, Dask, and Polars based on execution time and memory usage.

## Task 1: Dataset Selection

In this assignment, the 2019 Airline Delays and Cancellations dataset from Kaggle has been selected. This dataset provides comprehensive information about airline delays and cancellations across the United States in 2019 with 6,489,062 records and 26 data fields.
