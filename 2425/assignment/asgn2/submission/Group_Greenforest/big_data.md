<h2>Task 1: Dataset Selection</h2>

### 1.1 Dataset Details
For this assignment, the dataset chosen is titled **"New York City Bus Data"**, **sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stoney71/new-york-city-transport-statistics?select=mta_1712.csv) and 
uploaded by Michael Stone**. It contains real-time location data of buses operating under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York City. This dataset falls under the **urban mobility and public transportation domain**, making it ideal for studying large-scale, real-time data typically encountered by smart city infrastructure systems.

As shown in Figure 1.1, this dataset provides a comprehensive overview of bus movement data across New York City, making it highly relevant for urban mobility analysis. The dataset is approximately **1.33 GB in size** and contains about **6.4 million rows** and **17 columns**, which satisfies the criteria of being large and rich enough for exploratory and performance comparisons.

### 1.2 Features Included

<br><strong>Figure 1.2.1 - Data Columns and Row Counts from CSV File</strong> </p>

Figure 1.2 illustrates a sample view of the dataset's structure, including column names and record counts. Among the features included are various timestamp fields such as *RecordedAtTime*, *ExpectedArrivalTime*, and *ScheduledArrivalTime*, which are essential for tracking punctuality and delay patterns. Additionally, the dataset captures bus route identifiers like *PublishedLineName* and *DirectionRef*, as well as origin and destination information with corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates. The presence of live GPS locations, next stop predictions, and fields such as *DistanceFromStop* and *ArrivalProximityText* further enhances the real-time and operational value of this dataset.

### 1.3 Justification
This dataset is particularly suitable for a big data handling assignment because of its large volume, structured schema, and real-time characteristics. It offers practical opportunities to explore and apply big data techniques such as chunked or parallelized data loading, data type optimization for memory efficiency, and performance benchmarking using tools like Dask against traditional Pandas operations. Moreover, the dataset simulates a real-world use case where a transportation agency must process millions of records to monitor services, analyze delays, and optimize route planning.
