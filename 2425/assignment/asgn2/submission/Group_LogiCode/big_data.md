## 1.1 Objectives
## 2.0 Dataset Selection
## 3.0 Load and Inspect Data
To prepare the dataset for use, the Spotify Charts data was downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. The process began with installing the Kaggle package to enable command-line access to Kaggle resources. Then, the required credentials â€” Kaggle username and API key â€” were set manually as environment variables to authenticate the session. After successful authentication, the dataset was downloaded using the `kaggle datasets download` command and extracted from the ZIP archive. Once extracted, the dataset files were ready for inspection and further processing.
