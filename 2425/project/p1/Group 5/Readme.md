## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a high-performance data pipeline capable of extracting and processing **at least 100,000 structured pet adoption records** from a Malaysian web source. Our selected website is **[PetFinder.my](https://www.petfinder.my/)**.

We designed a system that:
- Crawls and scrapes data using `Scrapy`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and `Asyncio`.
- Stores raw and cleaned data in a **MongoDB NoSQL** database.
- Performs data cleaning and transformation using **Pandas (baseline)**, **Asyncio (FastAPI)**, **Modin**, **Dask**, and **PySpark**.
- Implements optimization techniques like **multithreading**, **multiprocessing**, and **distributed computing**.
- Evaluates and compares performance improvements based on execution time, memory usage, CPU utilization, and throughput.

## 🎯 Goals and Deliverables

- ✅ Collect large-scale pet adoption data from PetFinder.my
- ✅ Clean and transform datasets using Python tools
- ✅ Apply high-performance data processing techniques
- ✅ Compare performance of various libraries for data cleaning in terms of speed and efficiency
- ✅ Submit a full report, cleaned dataset, source code, and performance analysis

📄 **Report, code, and results** are organized in the respective subfolders.
