## 📌 Introduction

This project involves developing a web crawler to extract a large volume of news articles and then performing data processing tasks such as cleaning and preprocessing. The focus is on evaluating and optimizing the performance of these tasks using different Python libraries, specifically Pandas and Dask. By comparing these tools, the project aims to determine the most efficient approach for handling large-scale datasets in terms of speed and resource utilization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Develop a web crawler to extract at least 100,000 news articles from New Straits Times (NST) website.
- ✅ Save extracted data in CSV format for structured storage.
- ✅ Clean and preprocess the raw dataset to ensure quality.
- ✅ Compare performance before and after optimization using relevant metrics.
