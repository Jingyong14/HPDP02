Austronesian questions 

1. Are Austronesians homogeneous people?
 According to latest study, Austronesian speakers were not homogeneous, there are two subclades that associated to austronesians
DNA paternal terminology 
*O1A- Formosan/Native Taiwanese(not the current majority Chinese)
*O3A2B2-N6 - Proto Malay
However it is still unknown who really invented the austronesian language if the O1a or O3A2B2-N6 

2. Austronesian related DNA distribution/DNA paternal in population % in modern Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Filipinos= O1a 50% , O3a2b2-N6 20% 
Malaysians= O3a2b2-N6 50%  ,  O1a 10%
Indonesians=  O3a2b2-N6 40% , O1a 10%

By the way, the rest were Austroasiatic, Chinese ,Negritos, Indian.  DNA paternal 

3. Possible origins
O1a- Southern China
O3a2b2-N6 - Southern China, Mainland South East Asia

4. Closest modern population 
O1a= Native Taiwanese, Filipinos, Thai
O3a2b2-N6= Malay, Indonesians, Filipinos
By the way Thai is included in O1a since large of their modern DNA is also from Tai-Kradai wich carry O1a, although modern Thai today also have big Austroasiatic DNA paternal from Mon people (related to Khmer Cambodians) it's earlier people in modern Thailand before Tai Kradai migrated there)
Genetic relationships
Tai Kradai-speaking populations are thought to be genetically related to Proto Austronesian-speaking groups like Native Taiwanese. Some believe that the Tai kradai and Austronesian-speaking populations like native taiwanese may have descended from rice farmers in the Yangtze River valley, southern china","2:20

Austronesian questions 

1. Are Austronesians homogeneous people?
 According to latest study, Austronesian speakers were not homogeneous, there are two subclades that associated to austronesians
DNA paternal terminology 
*O1A- Formosan/Native Taiwanese(not the current majority Chinese)
*O3A2B2-N6 - Proto Malay
However it is still unknown who really invented the austronesian language if the O1a or O3A2B2-N6 

2. Austronesian related DNA distribution/DNA paternal in population % in modern Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Filipinos= O1a 50% , O3a2b2-N6 20% 
Malaysians= O3a2b2-N6 50%  ,  O1a 10%
Indonesians=  O3a2b2-N6 40% , O1a 10%

By the way, the rest were Austroasiatic, Chinese ,Negritos, Indian.  DNA paternal 

3. Possible origins
O1a- Southern China
O3a2b2-N6 - Southern China, Mainland South East Asia

4. Closest modern population 
O1a= Native Taiwanese, Filipinos, Thai
O3a2b2-N6= Malay, Indonesians, Filipinos
By the way Thai is included in O1a since large of their modern DNA is also from Tai-Kradai wich carry O1a, although modern Thai today also have big Austroasiatic DNA paternal from Mon people (related to Khmer Cambodians) it's earlier people in modern Thailand before Tai Kradai migrated there)
Genetic relationships
Tai Kradai-speaking populations are thought to be genetically related to Proto Austronesian-speaking groups like Native Taiwanese. Some believe that the Tai kradai and Austronesian-speaking populations like native taiwanese may have descended from rice farmers in the Yangtze River valley, southern china","2:20

the portuguese sent out small boats to approach it, and ordered it to halt but it promptly opened fire on the fleet, its crew hurling down spears, arrows, stones, gunpowder pots, and flammable materials. afonso de albuquerque approached it with his entire fleet. the portuguese began firing on the junk, but the cannonball bounced off the hull, then the junk sailed away. the portuguese ships then fired on the junks masts causing them to fall. near dawn, flor de la mar the highest portuguese carrack caught up and rammed the junk, while firing artilleries which killed 40 of the junks crew. the junk was so tall that flor de la mars rear castle could barely reach its bridge,note 4 and the portuguese does not dare to board it. their bombard shots did not damage it because it has 4 layers of board, while the largest portuguese cannon could only penetrate no more than 2 layers. when the portuguese tried to grapple it and attack in close combat, the crew set fire to their junk,note 5 forcing the portuguese to pull away. during the escape, the junks crew tried to put out the fire with great difficulty.note 6 after two days and two nights of fighting, albuquerque decided to break

sailed away. the portuguese ships then fired on the junks masts causing them to fall. near dawn, flor de la mar the highest portuguese carrack caught up and rammed the junk, while firing artilleries which killed 40 of the junks crew. the junk was so tall that flor de la mars rear castle could barely reach its bridge,note 4 and the portuguese does not dare to board it. their bombard shots did not damage it because it has 4 layers of board, while the largest portuguese cannon could only penetrate no more than 2 layers. when the portuguese tried to grapple it and attack in close combat, the crew

Lagipula siapa pula yang klaim bahwa kesultanan Malaka itu dikuasai orang Demak Jawa, saya tak klaim itu dan saya tau bahwa kesultanan Malaka itu sisilahnya orang semenanjung Malaya. Mereka dibantu kesultanan Demak untuk melawan Portugis dan mengusirnya .
Dan orang Portugis menulis bahwa Adipati unus itu raja Melaka itu salah kaprah karena Adipati unus cuma membantu sesama saudara Melayu dan sodara muslim untuk usir itu Portugis yang nak mengkrristen Nusantara","¬†@jintanmanis5000¬† saya bukan klaim tapi berbagai limu, karena terlalu banyak fakta dan catatan tentang orang Jawa bahkan dari abad ke 4 oleh orang China dan India. 

Tuh liat prasastinya bertebaran di mana mana itu sejarah bro bukan claim yg claim itu siapakah?

a modern concept, created in the second half of the 20th century. however, contemporary malaysia regards the entire history of malaya and borneo, spanning thousands of years back to prehistoric times, as its own history, and as such, it is treated on this page. an early western account of the area is seen in ptolemys book geographia, which mentions a golden khersonese, now identified as the malay peninsula.1 hinduism and buddhism from india and china dominated early regional history, reaching their peak during the reign of the sumatrabased srivijaya civilisation, whose influence extended through sumatra, java, the malay peninsula and much of borneo from the 7th to the 13th centuries. although muslims had passed through the malay peninsula as early as the 10th century, it was not until the 14th century that islam first firmly established itself. the adoption of islam in the 14th century saw the rise of several sultanates, the most prominent were the sultanate of malacca and the sultanate of brunei. islam had a profound influence on the malay people but has also been influenced by them. the portuguese were the first european colonial powers to establish themselves on the malay peninsula and southeast asia, capturing malacca in 1511, followed by the dutch in 1641. however, it was the english who, after initially establishing bases at jesselton, kuching, penang and singapore, ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now malaysia. the anglodutch treaty of 1824 defined the boundaries between british malaya and the dutch east indies which became indonesia. on the other hand, the anglosiamese treaty of 1909 defined the boundaries between british malaya and siam which became thailand. the fourth phase of foreign influence was an immigration of chinese and indian workers to meet the needs created by the colonial economy in the malay peninsula and borneo.2 japanese invasion during world war ii ended british rule in malaya. the subsequent occupation of malaya, north borneo and sarawak from 1942 to 1945 unleashed a wave of nationalism. after the japanese surrender from malaya due to being defeated by the allies, malayan union was established in 1946 by the british administration but following opposition by the ethnic malays, the union was reorganized as the federation of malaya in 1948 as a protectorate state until 1957. in the peninsula, the malayan communist party took up arms against the british and the tension led to the declaration of emergency rule for 12 years from 1948 to 1960. a serious military response to the communist insurgency as well as the baling talks in 1955 led to the establishment of independence for malaya on 31 august 1957 through diplomatic negotiation with the british. tunku abdul rahman became the first prime minister of malaysia. in 1960, the termination of emergency occurred as the communist threat decreased and their withdrawal to the borders between malaya and thailand. on 16 september 1963, the federation of malaysia was formed following the merger of the federation of malaya, singapore, sarawak and north borneo sabah. approximately two years later, the malaysian parliament passed a bill without the consent of signatories of the malaysia agreement 1963 to separate singapore from the federation.3 a confrontation with indonesia occurred in the early1960s. race riots in 1969 brought to the imposition of emergency rule, the parliament suspension, the establishment of the national operations council noc, and the proclamation of rukun negara by noc in 1970 which became the national philosophy in promoting unity among the citizens.45 new economic policy was also adopted in 1971 that was used until 1991 which sought to eradicate poverty and restructure society to eliminate the identification of race with economic function.6 this policy was continued with the national development policy from 1991 to 2000. in the late 1990s, malaysia was struck by the asian financial crisis and political turmoil following the removal of deputy prime minister anwar ibrahim.789 since 1970, the barisan nasional coalition headed by united malays national organisation umno had governed malaysia until its defeat in the 2018 malaysian general election to pakatan harapan coalition. in late 2018, there were massive protests against the governments plan to ratify the icerd in malaysia, especially from bumiputras, hence pressuring the government to cancel the conventions ratification as it may jeopardise the constitution.10 in february 2020, the recent political crisis in malaysia started when the pakatan harapan coalition fell as bersatu, bn, pas, gps, and gbs party members come together to form a government named perikatan nasional led by bersatu leader muhyiddin yassin. i got this from wikipedia","history of malaysia malaysia is located on a strategic sea lane that exposes it to global trade and various cultures. strictly, the name malaysia is a

the communist insurgency as well as the baling talks in 1955 led to the establishment of independence for malaya on 31 august 1957 through diplomatic negotiation with the british. tunku abdul rahman became the first prime minister of malaysia. in 1960, the termination of emergency occurred as the communist threat decreased and their withdrawal to the borders between malaya and thailand. on 16

parliament passed a bill without the consent of signatories of the malaysia agreement 1963 to separate singapore from the federation.3 a confrontation with indonesia occurred in the early1960s. race riots in 1969 brought to the imposition of emergency rule, the parliament suspension, the establishment of the national operations council noc, and the proclamation of rukun negara by noc in 1970

society to eliminate the identification of race with economic function.6 this policy was continued with the national development policy from 1991 to 2000. in the late 1990s, malaysia was struck by the asian financial crisis and political turmoil following the removal of deputy prime minister anwar ibrahim.789 since 1970, the barisan nasional coalition headed by united malays national organisation

crisis in malaysia started when the pakatan harapan coalition fell as bersatu, bn, pas, gps, and gbs party members come together to form a government named perikatan nasional led by bersatu leader muhyiddin yassin. i got this from wikipedia","History of Malaysia:

Malaysia is located on a strategic sea lane that exposes it to global trade and various cultures. Strictly, the name ""Malaysia"" is a modern concept, created in the second half of the 20th century. However, contemporary Malaysia regards the entire history of Malaya and Borneo, spanning thousands of years back to prehistoric times, as its own history, and as such, it is treated on this page.

An early western account of the area is seen in Ptolemy's book Geographia, which mentions a ""Golden Khersonese,"" now identified as the Malay Peninsula.[1] Hinduism and Buddhism from India and China dominated early regional history, reaching their peak during the reign of the Sumatra-based Srivijaya civilisation, whose influence extended through Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula and much of Borneo from the 7th to the 13th centuries.

Although Muslims had passed through the Malay Peninsula as early as the 10th century, it was not until the 14th century that Islam first firmly established itself. The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of several sultanates, the most prominent were the Sultanate of Malacca and the Sultanate of Brunei. Islam had a profound influence on the Malay people but has also been influenced by them. The Portuguese were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and Southeast Asia, capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the English who, after initially establishing bases at Jesselton, Kuching, Penang and Singapore, ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 defined the boundaries between British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies (which became Indonesia). On the other hand, the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 defined the boundaries between British Malaya and Siam (which became Thailand). The fourth phase of foreign influence was an immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs created by the colonial economy in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.[2]

Japanese invasion during World War II ended British rule in Malaya. The subsequent occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak from 1942 to 1945 unleashed a wave of nationalism. After the Japanese surrender from Malaya due to being defeated by the Allies, Malayan Union was established in 1946 by the British administration but following opposition by the ethnic Malays, the union was reorganized as the Federation of Malaya in 1948 as a protectorate state until 1957. In the Peninsula, the Malayan Communist Party took up arms against the British and the tension led to the declaration of emergency rule for 12 years from 1948 to 1960. A serious military response to the communist insurgency as well as the Baling Talks in 1955 led to the establishment of independence for Malaya on 31 August 1957 through diplomatic negotiation with the British.

Approximately two years later, the Malaysian parliament passed a bill without the consent of signatories of the Malaysia Agreement 1963 to separate Singapore from the Federation.[3] A confrontation with Indonesia occurred in the early-1960s. Race riots in 1969 brought to the imposition of emergency rule, the parliament suspension, the establishment of the National Operations Council (NOC), and the proclamation of Rukun Negara by NOC in 1970 which became the national philosophy in promoting unity among the citizens.[4][5] New Economic Policy was also adopted in 1971 that was used until 1991 which sought to eradicate poverty and restructure society to eliminate the identification of race with economic function.[6] This policy was continued with the National Development Policy from 1991 to 2000. In the late 1990s, Malaysia was struck by the Asian financial crisis and political turmoil following the removal of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.[7][8][9]

Since 1970, the Barisan Nasional coalition headed by United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) had governed Malaysia until its defeat in the 2018 Malaysian general election to Pakatan Harapan coalition. In late 2018, there were massive protests against the government‚Äôs plan to ratify the ICERD in Malaysia, especially from Bumiputras, hence pressuring the government to cancel the convention's ratification as it may jeopardise the constitution.[10] In February 2020, the recent political crisis in Malaysia started when the Pakatan Harapan coalition fell as BERSATU, BN, PAS, GPS, and GBS party members come together to form a government named Perikatan Nasional led by BERSATU leader Muhyiddin Yassin.

All Borneo territories are not geographically and not originally part of Malingsia anytime our garbage documents of the stupid Tunku Abdul Rahman's dream of proposal of merging or landgrabbing Borneo Colonies to Federation of Malingsia (Malaya now Peninsula) through garbage Malingsia Agreement 1963 (MA63) or Malingsia formation are trash abolish dissolve and thrown away forever. We Malingsians will surely return to our nightmare of original territory of Federation of Malingsia (Malaya now Peninsula) who became independent territory since August 31, 1957 while Borneo are British Colonies without MA63.

No Borneo. No Spratly Islands. No China Dispute. No Philippines Dispute. No Malingsia-Indonesia Borneo Border. No Malingsia Borneo Flag. No Malingsian Bornean Citizenship. No Malingsian Bornean Language. No Malingsian Bornean Military. 
We only returned to our nightmare of Federation of Malingsia (Malaya now Peninsula) since 1957 without stupid Tunku's MA63 without Borneo territories anymore.
