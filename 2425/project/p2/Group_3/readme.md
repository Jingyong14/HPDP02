## üîç Introduction

This project details the design and development of a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline leveraging Apache technologies. The primary aim is to collect and analyze substantial volumes of online news data to discern user sentiments regarding a product, event, or social issue pertinent to Malaysia. The initiative provides a practical application for exploring natural language processing (NLP) techniques, developing machine learning or deep learning models for sentiment classification, and establishing a scalable system architecture. This system utilizes Apache Spark for big data processing and Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming. Insights derived from the processed data will be stored and visualized using tools such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.
