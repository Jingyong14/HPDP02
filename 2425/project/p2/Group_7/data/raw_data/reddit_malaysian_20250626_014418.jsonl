I dont know if age plays a part but seems like almost every guy.. maybe even girls too here are just so okay with not using a condom with someone new.. \n\nIt frustrates me a lot because even though i strictly ask for a condom, they would say yes but at the end tell me they didn’t put it on OR they would take it off mid-sex? Which is so crazy to me? \n\nAlthough we can be transparent on when was the last time we got checked, i still wouldn’t take their word for it and still request protection. I could’ve easily lied to them about that information and so can they. Though it always seems so one-sided, Im always so worried and cautious about this meanwhile they’re just so chill. Is it because they rarely experience symptoms if they do have anything? Because it seems to me girls are more likely to show symptoms while men stay asymptomatic so they dont feel the need to go and get checked unless they actually see/feel something wrong. \n\nMost of the guys when i asked, they mention they get checked every year or every 6 months. Which i thought wasn’t enough if they are somewhat sexually active… right? \n\nEven if they were to use a condom, i realised they only use it to prevent pregnancy and they think im requesting protection just because of that which isn’t completely wrong but mostly for STD’s as well?!? When i show i’m visibly upset they didnt use a condom when i asked, all they say to reassure me is ‘ i didn’t cum inside’ yeah okay, im worried about the other things too you know… ", "score": 5, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1750868632.0, "created_date": "2025-06-25T16:23:52+00:00", "author": "hoodiesnake", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1lka6bd/is_sexual_healthrisks_not_taken_seriously_here_or/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:43:45.454692+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

I will also add that career advancement and getting ahead in branding and marketing has a lot to do with experience and networking.\n\nComparing 3 years working experience vs 3 years to get your degree, employers may lean more towards your working experience as you are more likely to be able to hit the ground running. However, getting that 3 years work experience could be a tough long road depending on whether you have someone willing to teach you the basics on the job or you are left to figure it out on your own.

We were very close back then: we played together almost every day, joked around, and she often came over to my house. Her Auntie used to call her by a nickname (which I still remember), but sadly, I never knew her full real name.\n\nWe lost contact when I entered secondary school, and eventually both our families moved to different places. The last time she came back to the old house to pack up her things, my father met her and her Auntie — but I missed the chance because I was away at university during exam week. That moment still stays with me.\n\nAll I know now is:\n\nWe lived in Lorong Bulan, Taman Tasik Permai,Taiping,Perak.\n\nShe is possibly studying in Taiwan now — but I don’t know which university.\n\nShe may be using a different name on social media, which makes it harder to find her.\n\nI’ve searched through social media, Malaysian student groups in China and Taiwan, but I haven’t been able to trace her. I know this is a long shot — but maybe, just maybe, someone reading this might recognize her story, or know someone who fits the description.\n\nI don’t mean to disturb anyone’s peace. I just want to reconnect — to say hi, to express my gratitude for the memories, and maybe find some closure… or a second chance.\n\nIf anyone has any leads, feel free to DM me privately.

Am unable to find the original job posting now but believe it was under a company called Naga HR Industries Recruitment Agency. Was further contacted by a 'Michelle Tan' on WhatsApp (+60 11-6385 2866) who explained the job details as attached. Luckily something seemed off to me, as no legit organisation will ever conduct interview and training fully via WhatsApp but I played along la for the 'training'. Supposedly it is for hotel reviews but everything in the training was similar to [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/18kazc1/warning\\_remote\\_hotel\\_task\\_jobs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/18kazc1/warning_remote_hotel_task_jobs/)\n\nYou have 38 tasks / reviews a day to complete but for some reviews you need to top up.\n\nPLEASE BE AWARE AND DO NOT FALL FOR SUCH SCAMS. No legit job would ever require a 'top up' to complete tasks. Sharing this as it just happened to me and I hope others do not get scammed too.\n\nSome of her msgs below for your reference -\n\nHi, X, I'm Michelle! 😊  \nI got your contact from S Yume Mishra (Naga HR Industries Recruitment Agency). I'm the person in charge of this role (Data Entry Specialist) that you applied on LinkedIn.  \nI will send you the job details over here, hope that's okay?  \nKindly confirm the attached file is your resume as well, TQ.\n\nThanks for getting back and nice to e-meet you, X! 😊  \nI’ll be sharing the job details below, feel free to take your time to go through them, ya 👍🏻  \nJob position: Remote Data Entry Specialist  \nSo just a quick intro — this is a fully remote, home-based role that won’t interfere with your main job. You’ll only need your phone to complete the tasks, and yes, you’ll get paid for it.  \nThe work is done through a platform called ALEO, which is operated by WIZ Holdings Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based company that focuses on marketing and AI-powered customer engagement.\n\nWhat we actually do is help hotels increase their online presence by boosting their ratings and reviews, so they can attract more customers and investors.  \nAs for your role, it’s very straightforward — you just need to submit hotel rating data on the ALEO platform. Every successful submission earns you a commission. That’s basically it — simple and flexible!\n\nHere is a clear breakdown of the payment structure.  \nFirstly, there are actually two types of hotel orders,\n\n1. Normal bookings — these give you a 1% commission based on the hotel price.\n2. Special deals — these come with a higher 3% to 50% commissions, depending on the case. But just to note, special deals are less frequent based on S&D. All bookings are auto-assigned by the platform system, so you don’t get to choose manually. For example, if the system assigns you a normal booking for a RM300 hotel, you’ll earn RM3(1%). If it’s a special deal at 10%, that’s RM30. And a maximum of 38 hotel orders will be allocated daily. You will also be paid a weekly basic of $110 upon the 7th consecutive working day.\n\nTo start doing the tasks on the platform, you’ll need to sign up for a working account first. But don’t worry, the registration is completely free. 👍🏻😊  \nI’m actually doing this Aleo job as a side hustle myself too. Personally, I usually spend just 15–30 minutes a day to finish the assigned tasks, so it’s super flexible and you can work at your own pace whenever you’re free.\n\nJust got my laptop ready 👍🏻 let’s start with the working account setup. I’ll send you the registration link now  \n[https://aleovlz.com/en/register?pid=Fy6Pgsz](https://aleovlz.com/en/register?pid=Fy6Pgsz)\n\nOnce done, go to your profile > click “Invite” and send me your referral link. I’ll use that to create a sub account for your training  \nI'll also be funding this sub account with a starting capital so you can practice without using your own money. You’ll also earn 25% of the earnings, you can treat it as your training allowance. I will show you how to withdraw it later 😊\n\nYour job here is simple, just submit hotel ratings based on bookings assigned by the system. Each day, you’ll receive up to 38 hotel bookings to rate. These are real hotel listings pulled from platforms like [Booking.com](http://booking.com/), Agoda, and others. but don’t worry, your name won’t appear on any public reviewAleo stores all the booking data in the system and automatically assigns it to you for rating. Once you complete the task, Aleo uses your submission to generate real reviews on those platforms, and you’ll earn commissions for each one. So in a way, the commissions you earn are like the advertising fees paid by hotel providers. They're using Aleo’s marketing service to boost their visibility. Understand?\n\nAlright, so to do the rating, the system needs to simulate a booking, so we use funds from the account first, then once the rating is submitted, the full booking fee + commission will be remitted instantly into the balance.  \nSo we only need to deposit once, and reuse that same balance for the next bookings.  \nIt’s like a prepaid cycle. If there is no balance, no task will be assigned. But the minimum amount to get bookings is only $50.  \nI'll send you a few screenshots so you can follow easily 👍🏻\n\nSo you must be wondering if you need to put in your own money for the starting capital to do this job? Don't worry yeah, for the starting funds, I will provide to you, because you're still new in this 👍🏻😊\n\nI will explain to you about the difference between normal booking & super deal  \nAs you can see, this is a normal booking as we earn 1% commission on this booking  \nThen Super deal is a hotel booking which has a higher booking price than our starting funds, and it comes with a higher commissions rate (from 3% to 50%, depends on the availability)  \nSo how do we differentiate a normal booking and a super deal?  \nYou will see a pop up notification in the platform when the system has assigned one to you. Also take note all the bookings are randomly assigned by the system according to their availability. Sometimes when there are a lot of users rating hotel tasks at the same time, we might get lesser special deals  \nThese super deals are not many, I'd say it's actually depending on luck to get them. But of course it's a good thing if we are able to get it because we earn higher commissions from it\\~\n\nLast but not least, if we do receive a super deal, we'll need to top up the required amount to complete the booking and submit the rating, because super deals usually have a higher price than your current balance. You can also understand as \"Higher booking fee, higher earnings\" 👍🏻\n\nI only feel so stupid cause I did confirm my resume which has some personal details but luckily no address or bank details ke apa. The more emojis 'she' used, the more sus it seemed and once the training was underway it really screamed scam to me. Thank god for the reddit community and previous posts on this type of job scams.

{"id": "1lhijfn", "title": "Rules for live-in maid as first timers?", "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy wife (8 months pregnant with our first child) and I are about to hire our first live-in maid. We live in a 3-bedroom condo (1,000 sq ft).\n\nMaid’s profile: 40 y/o Indonesian, married, one child. Family all in indonesia. Maid will be sleeping in the middle room. It’s not ensuite, her toilet is just outside of her room. (Which is also the guest toilet)\n\nWhy we decided to get a maid? For daily cleaning, cooking, laundry, and (once the baby arrives) helping my wife with newborn care, etc helping around the house. Mostly assisting my wife with our newborn.\n\nMy question is :\n\nWhat are some rules I should set for my maid to have boundaries, privacy, no slacking, etc. or in another way, what rules should i set that my maid would not step on our heads? And other questions too.\n\nEg:-\n\n1.\t⁠What are the usual working hours? Eg:- Do you guys set 9am-6pm as working hours then after work she goes to her room and thats it for the day?\n\n2.\t⁠Do you keep the maids phone during the day and gives it back after work? So that she doesnt gets distracted too much? And starts slacking. Or worse when shes on the phone taking care of our newborn.\n\n3.\t⁠Does the maid eat together with you? Or do you set boundaries that the maid eat separately or another room (eg. Kitchen and dining room)?\n\n4.\t⁠Do you let the maids go out whenever she wants? Or 1 day off a month? Every sunday off? How is it usually is?\n\nThese are just some of my questions i can think of now. But pretty sure u guys get the gist.\n\nI mean i know everyone is different and it is how the employers true colours are when treating maids. Some treats them like shit, some balanced, some too lenient. But i am just worried about boundaries and taking advantage/stepping on our heads. I know i have to be firm and assertive. But i also feel strict rules will help a lot.\n\nOh and for privacy wise, i dont allow maid to come into masterbedroom unattended or without permission. I will have cctv every corner (especially to monitor baby), important stuff will be in safe box, etc.\n\nAnd i also understand employers have maids with them for decades and treat them as family, some have very good mutual respect and trust. But yeah, im asking before my maid starts her first day :)\n\nApologies if my post is a bit confusing, unclear, bad interpretation. I appreciate your responses tho.

{"id": "mz9n6zw", "title": "Comment on: Rules for live-in maid as first timers?...", "content": "Usually agent will also give some guidance especially if you are first-timer, you can ask them and then adjust it accordingly\n\n*1. What are the usual working hours? Eg:- Do you guys set 9am-6pm as working hours then after work she goes to her room and thats it for the day*? >> This depends on your needs. I know of some helper gets up at 530am (their employer gets up at 6am) and rest by 9pm but they have to wait until their employer goes to bed (like 11pm but they usually wait in their bedroom) before they also go to bed. Some gets up at 6am, rest by 8pm. It varies\n\n*2. Do you keep the maids phone during the day and gives it back after work? So that she doesnt gets distracted too much? And starts slacking. Or worse when shes on the phone taking care of our newborn.* \\>> This varies - agents usually advice not to let the helper hold their phones i.e. either give it to them once a week to call their family or give them at night for few hours, at the beginning at least. I have a friend who gave her new helper to carry phone all the time, the helper was on her phone all the time, slacks in house work and she know where is the CCTV location so she just go to hidden spots. Also heard of a helper who met a man and planned for her 'escape' with the man. You probably also have heard of these, it is not uncommon. My suggestion, if she's a young helper and inexperienced, you can maybe let her use her phone once a week first and if you are think she's alright, then let her have her phone after work and monitor her performance\n\n*3. Does the maid eat together with you? Or do you set boundaries that the maid eat separately or another room (eg. Kitchen and dining room)?* \\>> Again depends on your. My friend's helper have dinner together with them at the dining table, but there are some who are more comfortable to eat in the kitchen or eat at the dining table after employer is done\n\n*4. ⁠Do you let the maids go out whenever she wants? Or 1 day off a month? Every sunday off? How is it usually is?* \\>> During your interview with the helper, did you or your agent already talked about the duites and also day-off? Usually this will be communicated ahead as I know. Most employers do not give them a day off as I know, the employer will compensate for the day-off. Most are concerned if they go out, you never know who they will mix with etc etc. Pinoy helper might request for day-off to go to church or join their community but it should be negotiable\n\nYour helper is she experienced or inexperienced? If she is inexperienced, then it might take 3-6 months for her to get used to her job, and lots of patience needed to teach her especially if there is language barrier\n\nSet some house rules in the start - what are her priorities and what are the must-dos etc. You can be nice employer but be strict at the same time; and then slowly adjust based on your own comfort level, and depends on the helper's attitude.

{"id": "1lh7o60", "title": "Just graduated, kinda feeling lost now", "content": "Hey monyets,\n\nI just recently graduated with a PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) degree in an EU country via a scholarship.(No need to pay anything, just the cost of living though they did give some pocket money) Although it was tough, it was manageable. Now I feel a bit lost like I've been thrown in an ocean after a test in the swimming pool. \n\nThinking realistically now, I can't really work in Malaysia since my degree is not recognized. But I wasn't really thinking about my future since I was just so excited to get a scholarship to study abroad. It always has been a dream of mine to study abroad. Maybe I should have taken something that is less stringent requirements than Pharmacy but oh well, what is past is past. At least it's something I don't hate or have absolutely zero interest in.\n\nTbh I still believe I'm dreaming, as I'm the only person in my family to graduate and get a degree (my siblings just studied until SPM, they think they aren't cut out for Uni whereas my parents are studied until primary school) Now they have high expectations of me to get a good job and salary. They also help fund my cost of living in an expensive EU country (relative to Malaysia). But the more I research, the less confident I am in fulfilling their expectations. I still feel like a kid, just with slightly more knowledge and knowing what drugs is for which diseases lol. Furthermore, I also realized early during my studies that I need to take long breaks if I were to study for a long time like 8 hours and that is just studying. Working will probably take longer and it will be more intense and stressful, and I don't know if I can cope with it.\n\nI guess for now I will just try and relax from studying so much, and maybe study something else such as programming language and an actual language like Chinese (my vocabulary knowledge in Chinese is terrible, can't speak fluently to China Chinese people without using English words lol) as well as travel to East Asia (mainly for good food, Europe doesn't really have good food unfortunately)\n\nNot sure what to ask for though, I appreciate any advice or support from everybody, (I also sympathize with students who are about to take their final exams, it feels like no amount of studying is enough lol)", "score": 12, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1750542274.0, "created_date": "2025-06-21T21:44:34+00:00", "author": "Pillowish", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1lh7o60/just_graduated_kinda_feeling_lost_now/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:44:26.852798+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

However, I will not point out more than what is legal, so if you really want to talk about it, shoot me a PM instead. \n\nDeep breaths first. Not for you, it's for me. \n\nAssisted dying is not something to be taken lightly, so I will preface this by saying I am in a much better place right now, so don't worry about me. \n\nFirstly, it's illegal in Malaysia in any form. However, thankfully, your family will probably not be sued or be required to compensate for the trouble you caused by suicide, but then I'm not a lawyer. \n\nSecondly, it's legal in certain countries under certain circumstances. Please read this wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_die\n\nAs a corollary, I urge anyone who disagrees that you should have the rights to choose how to live and how to die to also understand that the ethics of this is very grey and not to judge. If you have the time and the inclination, please watch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett:_Choosing_to_Die \n\nThirdly, there are many pro-right-to-die websites that have methods that are said to be expedient and painless. Nobody really goes back to review that the They can be found with basic googling, after jumping through the hoops of suicide prevention. I don't think I can share it here, but if that's your choice then it is your choice. \n\nLastly, if you've read through all that and still think that your decision is final... I'm going to have to break my promise of not trying to talk you out of it. If you think that nothing will improve, suffice to say that I know all this because the same thoughts went through my head before. I still don't think that you should make such a permanent decision over things that might, in time, prove to be temporary.

I was new to the syllabus, especially subjects like Additional Mathematics and Physics, and it was a real struggle for me since I’m not from a privileged family. I only had a phone to join Google Meet, Zoom, and other online classes.\nBefore the lockdown, we did trial exams and I managed to get 8As and 2Bs . But during lockdown, everything went downhill. As I'm the type of student that need guidance .Sometimes classes were canceled because of internet issues, and I couldn’t get proper guidance.\nMy mom tried to enrol me in a tuition centre, but the teacher refused to take me in because I wasn’t Chinese. He said most of the students spoke Chinese. It wasn’t just one centre almost all the tuition centres in my area gave the same reason. I felt devastated. I couldn’t understand why they couldn’t just teach in Malay or English. It was so frustrating, and honestly felt really unfair.I ended up studying everything by myself...and it was not a fun process..\nIn the end, I got 5As for SPM. I was sad because I knew I could have done better if I’d had proper support. My school teachers weren’t very helpful either. Most of my Chinese friends got 8As or 10As.I was really sad and heartbroken that day looking at my parents face and it made me wonder if I should blame myself for not making my parents proud or if I was let down by the situation.\nDo you think this the tuition centre guy was racist?", "score": 8, "num_comments": 17, "created_utc": 1750402237.0, "created_date": "2025-06-20T06:50:37+00:00", "author": "RunPotential9179", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1lfxbs7/need_your_opinion_about_this/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:44:40.700279+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

All they had to do was to replace these and it everything went back to normal. Costed around RM200. \n\nOn my part, I contacted both the insurance and the workshop to send me their bill/quotation (aka part list) and neither parts were listed in the quotations. They tried to claim 5k from the insurer (1k in paintwork labour alone) but the insurance only approved around 3.3k. All in all I dont think its some kind of insurance fraud.\n\nSo now I'm pretty confident that the auto shop tried to swindle me by yanking out these parts and basically have me pay just to return them. My question is how can I report this shop? I dont think 200 is worth the hassle to fight over but I want to see them get some kind of repercussion. I cant imagine how many people they've swindled. \n\nIm thinking to report the shop to the insurance since they're a panel of the insurance. Has anyone pursued this avenue?

I'm on my 3rd month, and for the past 3 months I've been dealing with unpaid OTs, a supervisor that trying his best but have no idea what he's doing nor saying, a boss with anger issues that will make sure everyone in the office is as miserable as he is, and most importantly unrealistic expectations.\n\nDuring my interview with this company, I have told them multiple times I am a fresh graduate with limited skillsets, they acknowledged it and told me its fine there's seniors that will help me. First month in the company, the one and only senior left, so it means that I have to figure out all the stuff on my own with the other colleague that joined at the same time as me(but that guy is using another software I use so I still have to figure out all the stuffs on my own). It was overwhelming for me at first, and since my supervisor told me I can let him know if I'm struggling at work I told him about this. All he ever did is just giving me empty motivational talks lol. There was a period where I have to OT until 8\\~9pm for weeks straight(My working hours are supposed to end at 6pm), during that period my supervisor once said he'll give us a day of leave and when I'm done with the job I go asked him about this on this matter, but he told me that since I didnt OT until midnight so there's no leave for me(like wtf). Apart from that I also have to deal with my boss throwing tantrums, mismanagement and 2 other colleagues leaving, and also if I'm lucky, few meetings that is 2 hours of nothing.\n\nFor the past few months I've been convincing myself I'm only here to learn stuffs and saving up money so I can pay off my car loan. But I feel like I'm nearing the state where I start to can't withstand the atmosphere of this place anymore. My savings as for now can probably still pay off my monthly loan for 2 to 3 months, but I'm not sure is it a good idea or a stupid idea to leave now. Plus, this job took me 6 months to find, and I'm not feeling like getting back to the depressing job seeking period either.

I’m reaching out here with a hopeful heart, in case anyone out there might be able to help me reconnect with someone very special from my past.\n\nI’m looking for a childhood friend — a Chinese girl who used to be my neighbor when we were in primary school in Malaysia. We were very close back then: we played together almost every day, joked around, and she often came over to my house. Her Auntie used to call her by a nickname (which I still remember), but sadly, I never knew her full real name.\n\nWe lost contact when I entered secondary school, and eventually both our families moved to different places. The last time she came back to the old house to pack up her things, my father met her and her Auntie — but I missed the chance because I was away at university during exam week. That moment still stays with me.\n\nAll I know now is:\n\nWe lived in Lorong Bulan, Taman Tasik Permai,Taiping,Perak.\n\nShe is possibly studying in Taiwan now — but I don’t know which university.\n\nShe may be using a different name on social media, which makes it harder to find her.\n\nI’ve searched through social media, Malaysian student groups in China and Taiwan, but I haven’t been able to trace her. I know this is a long shot — but maybe, just maybe, someone reading this might recognize her story, or know someone who fits the description.\n\nI don’t mean to disturb anyone’s peace. I just want to reconnect — to say hi, to express my gratitude for the memories, and maybe find some closure… or a second chance.\n\nIf anyone has any leads, feel free to DM me privately. Thank you for reading this far and for any help — even a prayer is appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\n[Amad]", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1749923672.0, "created_date": "2025-06-14T17:54:32+00:00", "author": "zaphfran88", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://i.redd.it/lb9uu0dilx6f1.png", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:45:25.403016+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

Today I came to pick it up and the pomen told me there was problem with my brakes and engine. This was never brought up everytime I called them asking for updates.\n\nI told them the car was sent to perodua for the scheduled maintenance just a month prior to the crash and I had no trouble with it. I just told them I'll be seeing perodua and asking them for help and the pomen mentioned not to bring up the crash to perodua before giving my keys. \n\nbefore that he showed me what he fixed and what was still wrong. basically there was no internal damage to the parts outside of the car body. not even the engine had a problem and it was the closest to the front body. last I called insurance they said that the workshop claimed like 2-3k for everything which i didnt think to question because i thought it was basic procedure.\n\nwhen i drove back to the office i noticed that the speedometer was basically dead and the steering was uncharacteristically smooth to the point that it doesnt snap back like usual when turning. this was not brought up at all.\n\nso basically im thinking that the workshop was trying to pull a fast one on me for extra works but he wasnt trying pressing me for any further fixes.

There's also soy based protein. \n\nIn terms of macros protein powder is cheaper than tempe. From what I gather, Tempe is 19% protein by weight. Protein powder is usually 50-70%. At rm140 for 2kg, the protein powder I use (they mix all 3 types) gives me gives me about 1.33kg of protein, or rm106 per kg. \n\n1kg of protein from Tempe will mean you need... 5.26kg of the stuff. How much is that? I saw 100g packs going for rm10? So 5.26kg is... Rm526? For effective muscle growth you need about 2grams of protein per kg of bodyweight daily. That's.. assuming you're 80kg, about 160grams of protein? So you'd need to eat about 900grams of Tempe every day to meet those macros. \n\nAlso tempe is basically just fermented soybeans anyways. \n\nBut yeah if you're cash strapped go with natural protein sources. Protein shake is more efficient for protein per cost, but lacks other nutrients you need for daily use. But if compare pure cost for protein gain then protein powder is the best you can get. If you ask me tho, skip the meat in your diet and replace that with protein shake.

He even told me that we should be honored that he patronising us.\n\nThere's also employees from government bodies asking for discount. Reason? Because they work with the government and that we should give them certain privilege for it. \n\nWhen I declined to give them discount, they would berate me, telling me that I don't know how to run a business. Some worser encounter including them threatening that they won't patronise and the worst, is praying upon their God so that my shop will get less business.\n\nSometimes I feel the richer and older customers are more entitled than the younger ones.

A true gentleman.\n\nOn the flip side, we also had a Tan Sri who irritated the hell out of us. We had a policy that after a certain morning cut off period, we wouldn't allow outside food into our premises (there are other vendors nearby with their own food offerings).\n\nThis Tan Sri would come in around lunch time, order food from an outside vendor, sit down at one of our tables and eat.\n\nOthers would comment on the double standards, and we would explain to them that we didn't want a black eye.

I didn't think about it that much, he's a good friend anyway. \n\nAfter a while, around 3 days before my flight, he asked me to come by his house because he wants to talk about something. I went into his house, his parents weren't there, and then we just talked a bit. Then he dropped the bomb; he needed an extra RM400 for the ticket. I asked him why he didn't book it earlier, and that I don't mind lending him the money, but the total is outrageous for a flight ticket. He usually book MAS flights, so that explains the price. So i simply said to him that if he can't afford him, just buy the AirAsia ticket and just endure the leg pain. \n\nAt that point i was so skeptical, so I asked him firmly. He then broke down and told me that he's been blackmailed. Then I called another good friend of mine because I don't have that much money at hand, lo and behold the guy came and knocked on the door. We all just sat in the living room with him and asked him what the hell was going on. \n\nHe recently went on a date with this one girl, back in Sabah. I heard about her a bit, but didn't bother much because she didn't seem troublesome. So he told us that him and the girl already piap piap several times. When he was sleeping, the girl took picture of them shirtless, with his face very clear, sleeping beside her. This guy is quite well known in our uni, so I'd say the girl picked a pretty suitable victim for her blackmailing business. \n\nI asked him why he didn't report it to the police, and he said that it would ruin his reputation in uni (literally everyone knows him there) and the girl doesnt have an IC. After a few years studying in Sabah, I can safely say that not having an IC is a good perk to have to do crimes there. With immigration officers taking bribes as low as RM50, you can practically get away with anything.\n\nI'm at my wits end. I don't mind him piappiapping girls, but my money man. The guy keeps asking me some money too like I'm a mobile ATM, its pissing me off a lot. \n\nAnyone has any experience handling blackmail like this? I just want my money back, but I can't if the girl keeps taking his money.", "score": 18, "num_comments": 22, "created_utc": 1749505524.0, "created_date": "2025-06-09T21:45:24+00:00", "author": "Beautiful_Squirrel97", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1l7hhxq/my_friend_owe_me_rm1k_because_hes_been_blackmailed/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:46:14.499719+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

A friend of mine owns a **freehold condo valued around S$800–900k**, but he couldn’t get a loan despite having **S$50k in cash** sitting in the bank and eventually landing a **full-time job**. Even after staying employed at the same company for 6 months, the banks still declined him — *until he came across a non-traditional lender who was willing to consider the property as collateral without charging any upfront fees.*\n\nI’m wondering if the situation is any different in Malaysia. Have any of you tried borrowing against a fully-paid property without a steady income?

Lol.\n\nRef 1: i posted to anyone resigned w/o backup post (https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/s/DaLad6AeBD)\n\nRef 2: update (https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/s/lSul5MOshQ) \n\nAnd now here’s the final chapter.\n\nI returned the company’s assets. I am free.\n\nIt feels a bit weird because when i posted the first one it was the last working day before raya aidilfitri. Today, i left the firm on the last working day before raya aidiladha. So much can happen in 2 months.\n\nSo this is just a chill post about my thoughts. Because i dont have a blog to write.\n\nWhen i posted the first one, i was really on the verge of giving up on life. I even had the thought of “isnt it better if i die” during ramadhan where no syaitan. So the syaitan was myself. I guess.\n\nFew comments that struck me:- \n1. resigned without backup. But got offer while serving notice period. - me too. I rejected the verbal offer, and accepted the one i went interview while serving notice period \n\n2. Mindset shift after resigned. This is true. Once youre out you tend to see broader view. It was actually not that bad. Big 4 actually not that bad if you have a good team. But i have had enough la.\n\n3. Things will be okay. I took this with me. It was getting better the last two months. \n\nI really appreciate all the comments. I was able to enjoy raya after reading the positive comments. But i do see some regret their decision. I hope yall have things much better now.\n\nI have few weeks off. I will definitely do internal self reflection. To unlearn and relearn few things. And definitely put more thought on myself because more than 5 years I neglected my own self. \n\nI hope anyone going through the same will have things better and easier for them. Fightingggg !\n\nThanks.\n\nSelamat hari raya. \n\n", "score": 27, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1749226118.0, "created_date": "2025-06-06T16:08:38+00:00", "author": "Purple-Objective-841", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1l4wa3u/last_one_from_to_anyone_resigned_wo_backup/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:46:45.480354+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

{"id": "1l2xlkr", "title": "What do you think?", "content": "Hi. I just want to share what’s happening at the company I’m working at.  \n\nI moved from Sabah to work at a manufacturing company in Semenanjung in early 2024, bringing around 4 years of design and clerical experience. I was offered accommodation inside the factory, but living there was difficult because the boss and his son would call at odd hours during weekends and holidays, which I regret.\n\nDuring my interview, the boss told me to design a product catalogue for thousands of items, but my official title was General Clerk during probation. Despite being new and needing time to learn, I was pressured to finish everything quickly, often with urgent demands like “I’m going overseas tomorrow, get this done now.” Communication was hard because I spoke a different slang, and most workers were foreign mostly from Sri Lanka and Nepal.\n\nThe company is fully owned by a Chinese family. My probation was extended twice with feedback that I was too slow and didn’t socialize enough. Eventually, I was transferred to the QC and QA department when a new designer was hired. In QC/QA, I met a skilled colleague who had been with the company over 5 years but was never appreciated no recognition, no bonus, salary withheld without explanation, and often publicly humiliated. One day, after years of mistreatment, he finally expressed his frustration openly. Even though it’s not my business how other workers are treated locals or foreigners the toxic environment affects all of us. \n\nIt’s hard to say if it’s racism, bias, or just favoritism but if you’re not part of the main circle, you’re treated differently. The main office staff, especially those close to the boss’s family, enjoy comfort and respect, while teams like QC/QA are micromanaged and overworked.\n\nNow, all local staff are preparing to leave. These are people with deep knowledge of the products and systems people who built and maintained the very foundation of operations. \n\nAnd to be clear:\nEven foreign workers aren’t treated well. Their passports are held by HR under the excuse that the company is “afraid they’ll run away.” This is not only unethical it’s a violation of basic human rights. Many were brought here under sweet promises, only to be controlled and used.\n\nEven among local employees, if someone doesn’t like you personally may be pushed aside, regardless of your work ethic or contributions. It’s not about professionalism anymore. It’s about who’s in favour.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope this gives some perspective to others out there going through similar experiences. You're not alone. And no job is worth your health, dignity, or peace of mind. I’m not writing this to create drama or seek revenge. I’m just sharing this to raise awareness\n", "score": 15, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1749014883.0, "created_date": "2025-06-04T05:28:03+00:00", "author": "VirtualComforts2701", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1l2xlkr/what_do_you_think/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:47:11.321002+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

At the time of joining, the company reimbursed me for the payment in lieu of a shorter notice period with my previous employer. In connection with this, I signed a bond letter which states the following:\n\n>You will be required to refund the Company the said expenses in full if you resign before completion of 1 years' service with the company.\n\nIt is my understanding that the completion of one year of service refers to mid August **2025**. I am currently considering submitting my resignation at the end of June 2025 and intend to serve the full 3 month notice period, with my last working day being at the end of September 2025.\n\nGiven this, I would like to understand whether I would be required to refund the reimbursement amount to the company. My understanding is that despite submitting my resignation before mid August 2025, by serving the full notice period until the end of September 2025, I would have fulfilled the one-year service requirement, and therefore **would not** be required to make any refund.\n\nAny help on this is appreciated.

If you do, how do you manage them?\n\nSome background:\n\nOne of my managers left the company recently in a layoff, and I'm now reassigned to another manager  globally. Of course, with this I have to align the manager to the local practices and current project pipeline. As this manager is in a regional role overseeing several countries, I am not expecting to for him to understand down to the details and mechanics of how things were setup locally. However, the challenge comes when there are new projects which requires his approvals, to which he will apply the considerations of his native population, instead of looking at the issue from a historical and holistic perspective. I will have then spend hours of meetings and drafting emails to get my point across that what he is suggesting is possible, but contradicts what was required or goes against the local policy. Sometimes our meetings end up with me giving up on arguing as he keeps cutting me off and I just tell him that I'll address everything in an email/document - to which sometimes he does not even read and asks me instead the same question which I've addressed.\n\nSometimes I do agree with his points - to which I gladly align myself with what has requested but some of them will require a big revamp of the current system setup, which given some business controls and legal limitations in place, will be hard to achieve. And with the recent layoffs and restructuring in place, we're not getting enough competent resources to make these big changes. Mind you - this is an MNC with strong audit controls and most changes are done on a global scale. But sometimes I ask myself if really the cost and benefit of pursuing his recommendations are reasonable - given that what he is trying to induce changes are on things which have no problems with the stakeholders.\n\nI'm not looking at at quitting — pay is good and work environment is amazing. But, given that almost every day I'm risking myself a brain aneurysm - I'm contemplating.

Felt awful when I enter my foundation programme and I was the only one who didn't have a P licence yet.\n\nAnyway, I can't give advice on bike test since I didn't take it but for manual cars and driving in general, it's all about practice. I promise you that by the end of it all, you'll feel better about having taken the manual test. Nowadays, I'm driving an auto since only my brother has a manual and he uses it every day but it feels great learning to coordinate your limbs and senses when you get better at operating a manual transmission and it feels much easier driving an auto with the coordination that was acquired from driving a manual. I kid you not, I was hitting so many things inside and outside of the driving school when I practised with my bro's manual until clutch control and gear shifting became natural. I don't hit things now compared to back then.\n\nSo yeah, just hold your head high, keep practising, and trust the process.

And if your account gone right, you can have massive growth, it's more sustainable. However Tiktok rules is very strict and sometimes often doesn't give you the commission. And affiliate link only track the specific item. There is also less item on tiktok, you have to rely on viral items but also more competition. Also more chance for seller to frequently lower commission percent. \n\nMy advice though is to do both, both use mainly video format(but both also have link system) and if you up for it, do live also but please familiarise with commercial live rule.\n\nAnd don't forget to put in your TIN tax id and update income in lhdn even if rm1!", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1748564916.0, "created_date": "2025-05-30T00:28:36+00:00", "author": "sirloindenial", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1kx3emy/which_affiliate_program_is_better_in_malaysia/muzexuq/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:48:11.712376+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kx3emy"}

Commission rates are low unless it's a brand campaign. It’s a bit old-school, and tracking can be hit or miss.\n\n**Shopee:** Beginner-friendly. The interface is clean, and they offer regular bonuses during big campaigns. Commission rates are lower than before in some categories, but still stable if you drive real conversions. \n\n**TikTok:** If you’re active on TikTok or don’t mind doing short videos or even live selling, the potential is huge. Some sellers offer commissions up to 30-50% just to move stock. But yeah, it’s more hustle, you need to understand what goes viral, and keep testing products.\n\nAlso, a lot of TikTok affiliates and Shopee/Lazada sellers I know use [BigSeller](https://www.bigseller.com/en_US/index.htm) to source products from China (Taobao, 1688) and manage their orders across platforms.

Generally most apartments will be 3 bedders, and some SOHO/Suitess will be 1 or 2 bedder. These may or MAY NOT come with a carpark, please ask this.\n\nYou may be tempted to stay in a shared landed house but I promise this is a bad idea unless you are willing to take public transport every day. Generally carpark will be limited or none at all.\n\nWhen taking the lift to your unit, ask yourself if you will need an access card or if it's free access. A good condo management will have an access card system. They WILL bar your access card if your landlord doesn't pay their maintenance fees. A good way to check this is to take note of the management office phone number in every apartment you visit and give them a call as part of your due diligence when renting.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1748422829.0, "created_date": "2025-05-28T09:00:29+00:00", "author": "mrpokealot", "subreddit": "malaysians", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1kwvezj/tips_for_first_time_renters_in_kl/muo22yl/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T17:48:13.968555+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kwvezj"}
