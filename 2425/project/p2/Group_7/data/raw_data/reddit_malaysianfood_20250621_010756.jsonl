Lots of people think that wagyu is beef with a very high degree of marbling. That's actually not it. Wagyu simply refers to Japanese cow. If you eat beef in Japan, pretty much its all wagyu, and you pick the beef grade instead (A-5 in this case). So literally, if you take one of the Japanese Black calves from Japan (its actually a crime to do this btw, but lets say you managed it) and bring it to America, then raise it and butcher it there using the exact same practices, the resulting meat would not be considered as wagyu beef. \n\n  \nThis is a lot like luxury handbag branding. The copy can be exactly the same as the original, but is not the same unless it has gone through the branding and certification process. If you've been following the China luxury scandal recently, you'd understand what I mean. Brands like Louis Vuitton has been ordering 95% completed products from contract manufacturers in China only complete the 5% in their own factories with the attachment of the brand logo and other non essential parts, then selling the finished product at a 2000% markup.\n\n  \nSo to answer the original question.

Third day I started to feel like a cow myself. By the fourth day, I swear I could smell daging in my dreams. I looked at my plate and my soul just left my body.\n\nToday I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I ran to the nearest kedai and ordered nasi goreng ayam kunyit. No lembu. No kambing. Just simple ayam kunyit. I added green tea ice just to feel human again. That first bite‚Ä¶ bro, I nearly cried. It felt like I was tasting food for the first time. I wiped the plate clean. Left the veg of course, cause let‚Äôs be real.\n\nMoral of the story: daging is great.

{"id": "mxlg2tq", "title": "Comment on: Recommendations on places to eat in Kuala Lumpur a...", "content": "Here's a post outlining some very \"basic bitch\" recommendations for the KL/PJ area (I'd write about Penang, but that deserves its own post):\n\nSS2 is technically out in neighbouring Petaling Jaya/PJ, and that area is particularly known for Durian. If you're interested in Durian tasting, it's worth visiting, though there are many stalls (DurianMan, DKing, etc.)\n\nIf you're already visiting PJ, you can also try going to Damansara Uptown which has some famous restaurants. Most specifically Village Park for their Nasi Lemak.\n\nSea Park is another neighbourhood in PJ with a few popular spots: Thong Kee, Restoran Sea Park (especially at night for their Hokkien Mee), Nasi Lemak Bumbung.\n\nSpeaking of Hokkien Mee, you can considering going south to SS14, all the way to Restoran Ahwa for their Hokkien Mee too, which is particularly famous.\n\nAll of this is pretty spread apart though, so if you want to stay within KL you already know Chinatown/Petaling Street is a pretty popular area. I would say unique to the area is a bunch of famous Beef Noodle joints, and I'll give a recommendation for Soong Kee in particular. The Lala/Clam Noodles (from Lai Foong) in the area are also unique. Particularly popular in the area is Hai Kow Kopitiam for unique Hainanese western fusion breakfast that's popular in the peninsula.\n\nBut if you're willing to go further north, I would suggest for a Hainanese Kopi Tiam to make a trek out to Restoran Yut Kee. On the weekend, they basically serve porchetta.\n\nAlso north of Chinatown, in Chow Kit, there you can find a KL original dish: Chili Pan Mee, invented at Restoran Kin Kin, though now there are many competitors dedicated to this dish, such as Super Kitchen.\n\nIf you're staying in Bukit Bintang though, like a lot of tourists tend to do, I would suggest a meal at Hakka Restaurant. The atmosphere quite nice, and you can enjoy some Malaysian style Hakka Chinese cuisine.\n\nSpeaking of Hakka cuisine, on the east side of KL, if you're willing to venture further out in Ampang Jaya, there is an area famous for Hakka Yong Tau Foo. A bit far, but if you're willing to try, Foong Foong and it's nearby competitors might be worth visit.\n\nIf you're willing to go to Cheras in the southeastern side of KL, most people like to visit Yulek Wantan Mee for their Wantan Mee, which is considered by many to be top in the city.\n\nI would say Cheras and Ampang Jaya are out of th way, but most tourists at least make a visit to Batu Caves. If you're going to go up north to visit Batu Caves, I would highly recommend a visit to Pan Heong for their wat tan hor with river prawns.\n\nI leave it at that for now. There's a lot of food in the area honestly, but I listed probably the most famous ones.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1749834716.0, "created_date": "2025-06-13T17:11:56+00:00", "author": "FNMLeo", "subreddit": "MalaysianFood", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/MalaysianFood/comments/1lajp0x/recommendations_on_places_to_eat_in_kuala_lumpur/mxlg2tq/", "timestamp": "2025-06-20T17:28:45.387333+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lajp0x"}
{"id": "mxlro5q", "title": "Comment on: Recommendations on places to eat in Kuala Lumpur a...", "content": "A few dishes I'd recommend from Chinese or seafood restaurants:\n\n* You will see a dish called kam heong lala (\"kam heong\" meaning \"golden fragrant\" in Cantonese; lala meaning clams) at a Chinese restaurant at some point on your travels. I know the seafood/Chinese places in the SS2 Selera Malam sell it, and you can also get it at Wong Ah Wah or Sai Woo on Jalan Alor. But you can get this almost anywhere.\n* You'll also see \"ikan bakar\" at a lot of seafood places, whether Chinese or Malay. This typically refers to a dish of grilled fish that's been marinated in sambal. This is also a must-order. Similar to kam heong lala, there's no particular place that you have to get this; if you see it, order it.\n* You'll probably want a vegetable dish to go with your proteins and carbs; kangkung belacan (water spinach stir fried in spicy shrimp paste) is a Malaysian classic. Again, you can get this \\~anywhere.\n\nOther dishes I'd recommend and places to get them:\n\n* Bak kut teh -- a Malaysian herbal pork bone soup (it's different from the Singaporean dish of the same name, though they are both pork soups). A \"dry\" version of the soup is also extremely popular; I recommend trying both soup and dry bak kut teh. Unfortunately I don't know of a place in downtown KL I'd recommend; people recommend getting this in Klang, where it was invented, but that's a trek for a tourist. Since you're up for the trip to SS2, I've had a decent experience at Yip Yong: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/QzvfmuJvVQcQuMLH9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QzvfmuJvVQcQuMLH9)\n* Satay -- Malaysians will tell you to go to Kajang where it was invented but you can probably get a decent rendition in Kampung Baru near KLCC; I don't have any specific recommendations there, though. Personally I usually take foreign visitors to Wong Ah Wah or Sai Woo on Jalan Alor, and we order the dishes I mentioned above + satay and grilled chicken wings -- it's expensive by Malaysian standards but still very good IMO.\n* Banana leaf rice -- essentially a South Indian thali (plate of white rice served with various curries) served on a banana leaf, this is an extremely popular Malaysian meal especially for lunch. You can get a decent version at a lot of Indian restaurants especially ones in the Brickfields area (next to KL Sentral), but if you're able to make it to Bangsar, I really like Maya.

Outer layer is just the breading.\n\n2.) nachos. With a hint of burnt taste. \n\n3.) chicken taco. At first I thought it's pure meat wrapping the fillings. Like those kfc double down burgers. But nope, it's literally a mixture of meat and flour made into a shape of taco. Like those frozen food section kind of meat.\n\n4.) crispy taco. The filling was so moist that it literally made it into moist damp taco which broke in the middle. \n\n5.) the remaining wraps. Burrito or quesadilla whatever you want to call it, basically has a thicker layer of breading than the fillings. Even Pasar Malam murtabak during Ramadan also lose. Macam eating roti with meat and vege seasoning. \n\nWill be my last time trying them. Seriously, why people still go to them when there are better options...like stuffed.

I finally got a chance to try Mon the other and I have to say I was rather underwhelmed. Meat mince was spiced and relatively tasty but I feel it lacked strong flavour. This is important because the the pastry was completely unseasoned, with not even a hint of salt. What's even less to my liking is while the exterior was nice and crisp, the inside layers were doughy/dumpling-like, not to mention being very greasy. Also the meat-to-dough ratio is just off, there's just way too much dough and the paltry meat filling just doesn't leave much of an impression.\n\nNo such issue with Jipinhe for me. Completely baked through, without excess oil, filled to the brim with meat chunks, properly seasoned. They're pricier of course but I'd rather pay premium for quality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz0psklfro4f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4611c42968752b7b682e2f707aa992e7c90a273d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xx6tozkfro4f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915d7655c6a2d2f7157bc720912914011a8e57dd\n\n", "score": 7, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1748944977.0, "created_date": "2025-06-03T10:02:57+00:00", "author": "Amphedesque", "subreddit": "MalaysianFood", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianFood/comments/1l2802b/mon_beef_roti_vs_jipinhe_scones/", "timestamp": "2025-06-20T17:29:59.965241+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

Nirwana is the most famous place in KL for banana leaf rice (it was known even long before Michelin really put it on the international map), but it's overrated. If you can make it to Bangsar (where Nirwana is, not that far from Perdana Botanical Gardens), I really like Maya -- it's where I take all my foreign visitors. There are probably decent places to get banana leaf rice near Batu Caves but I'm not familiar with that area.\n\nIn Penang I am not sure if you'll find great food near Penang Hill -- the restaurants in its immediate vicinity struck me as tourist traps when I visited. Locals might have recommendations. When I visit Penang I do virtually all my eating around George Town. \n\nIn Penang, I always make it a point to visit Chulia Street at night for the street food -- there are many daily night markets serving street food in George Town so it's hard to go wrong as a tourist, but I've personally found Chulia Street to be my favourite in terms of convenience and selection. I'm sure locals will have better recommendations.\n\nMake sure you have asam laksa and char kuay teow when you're in Penang (both unfortunately not vegetarian, at least in their traditional incarnation). I like getting both these dishes from Penang Road Famous Laksa in George Town, but I also often order them from random hawkers around George Town and have basically never had a bad experience doing so.\n\nAlso worth checking out in George Town: Pitt Street Koay Teow Th'ng. Koay Teow Th'ng is basically a noodle soup (unfortunately also not vegetarian-friendly), but Pitt Street's version includes eel fishballs which are mindblowingly good. I don't even like fishballs most of the time, but I make it a point to visit Pitt Street Koay Teow Th'ng at least once for breakfast every time I'm in Penang.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1748367382.0, "created_date": "2025-05-27T17:36:22+00:00", "author": "johnleemk", "subreddit": "MalaysianFood", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/MalaysianFood/comments/1kwjk68/looking_for_restaurantfood_suggestions_near_my/mujvbwb/", "timestamp": "2025-06-20T17:30:50.843807+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kwjk68"}

Worth walking through at least once in the evening just for the atmosphere. And while they are overpriced by local standards, eating at Sai Woo or Wong Ah Wah is still worth it IMO for foreign tourists. When I bring foreign visitors to Jalan Alor I'll take us to either Sai Woo or Wong Ah Wah (they are basically interchangeable IMO). The must-order items are the chicken wings and satay, and if you like seafood, order something from the plentiful options on the menu (kam heong lala -- fragrant stir fried clams -- and grilled stingray are my two seafood go-tos at these restaurants).\n\nThat said, if you can't squeeze a meal at Jalan Alor in, it's not the end of the world at all. There are many similar restaurants in Penang that you can go to and which will be both better and cheaper. Song River Cafe is my go-to Penang restaurant for chicken wings and satay, and they have a seafood stall too where I often order grilled stingray.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1748368109.0, "created_date": "2025-05-27T17:48:29+00:00", "author": "johnleemk", "subreddit": "MalaysianFood", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/MalaysianFood/comments/1kwjk68/looking_for_restaurantfood_suggestions_near_my/mujxzgi/", "timestamp": "2025-06-20T17:30:50.849071+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kwjk68"}

{"id": "mtumanj", "title": "Comment on: Malaysian Chicken Curry...", "content": "Hi OP what curry powder / product will you use or have? Just mix the powder with some water (making sort of paste or slurry, I always make mine a bit on the thicker side, but others make it more watery - if your curry base is paste then adjust the thickness with water) and then cook the mixture over fire (obvi with all the shallots and garlic etc already frying and 'smelling' in some oil). Cook until the curry-shallot-garlic paste looks shiny with little specks of oil on top (which will look a bit darker compared to the cooking oil - this is apparently the oil fron the curry spices as they cook) - if you have a more watery mixture then you will need to cook it longer, vice versa. \n\nThen campak2 your protein into the kuali, making sure the curry mixture coats the cut pieces well (I would have marinated the protein well ahead with the curry powder - not mixed with water, just the curry - and salt etc to taste). Then baru add in water to just submerge the pieces, and add in any potato / carrot etc as you prefer, and let simmer until potatoes / carrots are soft (the protein would have cook by then). I usually will also marinate the pot/carrot in some salt water just to flavor and soften them up a bit before the cooking.\n\nAdjust the final flavor of the curry to taste, obvi.\n\nTo answer your question: the oiliness comes mostly from the curry spices cooking in the oil earlier, and additionally if you use coconut milk then yes from that too (more if you use something like concentrated coconut milk as opposed to reconstituted milk with coconut flakes ie 'santan cair'). Others can chime in regards other oil sources like kerisik (dried toasted coconut flakes/grates), as per the famous Che Nom's chicken curry recipe, which can be used also - I don't because where I am kerisik is a bit expensive, I usually already am using coconut milk so it's just repeating coconut flavor, personally I prefer kerisik more for rendang dishes and/or kenduri food, and lastly I have found kerisik - if not cooked well - makes the food spoil faster.
