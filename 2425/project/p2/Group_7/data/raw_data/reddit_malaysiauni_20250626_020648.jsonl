Do you know my first CGPA? 1.67 since i fail my math & physics. I came from B40 family, 1st child to go to university. no one in my family know how to even calculate a cgpa. I was from technical school from Form 4-5, we did not calculate cgpa. My reaction when i receive the result is just \"mehhhh\"... My dad got a letter from uni saying I'll be expelled if I did not get 2.0 cgpa next sem. He then drove to PJ, call me down and give me a 2 hour lecture at the parking lot. I sit at the curb for the whole duration. there was no reddit back then 😮‍💨.\n\nAfter that I went to my room at stares at the ceiling thinking about my current semester. Reality strikes... I dont even like engineering since I am so into computer stuff but thats the only option I got. So that semester i struggle to study stuff i dont like. Retake physics & math for the 2nd time and fail again on physics but manage to pass on math. Overall cgpa goes to 2.1, supported by other subjects. So i did not get expelled. Manage to pass my physics on my 3rd try. Then come chemistry, fail 2x rinse and repeat. Fucking hate chemistry equation I cant even relate.....so officially I'm extending my matriculation course from 1.5years to 2 years.\n\nGoes to uni, again failing statics 3x, dynamics x1, repeat math level 2/5 3x. My cgpa never comes close to 3.0, but I survived by scoring back all subjects from 3rd yeard & 4th year onwards...From all this, I know that I'm stupid and not suited for science course BUT it proves that hard works never betray you. After graduation even with low cgpa I manage to secure a job in MNC's and now I can say I'm in a comfortable salary. I learned my lesson a bit late, why dont you start to learn it early? Just check if you do these things and start improving.\n\n1) Used to copy assignment\n2) Never ever take a chance to meet lecturer when i dont understand\n3) Stay late for DOTA\n4) Skip class\n5) Sleep in class\n6) Never relates whatever I learn to real life situation.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750856596.0, "created_date": "2025-06-25T13:03:16+00:00", "author": "StunningOrange2258", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lk0ekw/what_should_i_do_now/mzov9aa/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:00:05.758531+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lk0ekw"}

{"id": "1ljwq5q", "title": "Felt guilty for using parents money", "content": "I'm Malay, just finished my SPM, and currently waiting for university admission. I really like aviation, especially doing mechanical things. So, my parents and I decided to enroll me at UNIKL MIAT since it has a good reputation in the aviation industry. The overall fee was RM30k+, which is reasonable compared to other private institutions. They provide accommodation early, which is easy to manage.\n\nSuddenly, my father told me he changed his mind and wants me to enroll in another place that offered the same course (B1.1) with guaranteed job placement, but the fee is three times more than UNIKL MIAT (RM100k+). At first, I protested but eventually accepted it since he really insisted on enrolling me there. (I’m not going to fight with my dad just because of university admission.) I researched it, and yes, I confirmed it is indeed a very good place to get your LAE and job. But the thing is, it doesn’t offer accommodation for the early semesters like UNIKL did, so I need to rent an apartment from day one.\n\nBoth my parents work for banks in KL, and their salaries are quite high. The problem is, my father really doesn’t commit to managing it. He just paid the entrance fee and left my mother and me to manage everything. He keeps himself busy during weekends by cycling with his friends, comes home just to eat and sleep, and then he’s gone again — and the cycle repeats.\n\nMy mother is almost breaking down in tears because she and I have to manage everything by ourselves — transportation, accommodation, education loans, medical checkups, etc. She always complains about how my father is just an ignorant person who doesn’t care about his family. Now I’m feeling guilty because my dad’s decision is really harming my mother. My mother is a busy person. Handling it by herself is not right.\n\nWhen I said to my mother that I want to stay at UNIKL, she simply said, \"Your father already paid the entrance fee. We can’t go back anymore.\"\n\nAm I an asshole? What should I do? I’ve always thought, since I was seven years old, that money isn’t everything. Should I give up or just continue with the flow?\n\nSeeing my friends go to UPU and other less pricey private institutions without troubling their parents made me think: Am I actually my parents’ asset or just a liability?\n\n", "score": 35, "num_comments": 11, "created_utc": 1750826725.0, "created_date": "2025-06-25T04:45:25+00:00", "author": "Frosty_Tangerine833", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1ljwq5q/felt_guilty_for_using_parents_money/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:00:11.853237+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

I did try to be friendly though, like smiling and all, but the other two just havent really acknowledged me 😭\n\nThe biggest challenge is pretending like I actually pray. I dont wear the hijab and Im not religious, but my roommates are super religious. We had to go for morning prayers today and luckily, they didnt ask me to come along with them, but I already feel like I’m walking on eggshells.\n\nI really dont want to fake my faith just to fit in, but Im also lowkey scared Ill end up on the matrics confession group just cs Im not religious enough. I just wanna find someone here whos on the same wavelength, but judging from the convos Ive overheard from other students… its not looking too promising 😭😭😭 Can i ever get away with not praying ", "score": 89, "num_comments": 62, "created_utc": 1750718819.0, "created_date": "2025-06-23T22:46:59+00:00", "author": "Otherwise-Teacher789", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1liuxss/religious_roommates_in_matriks/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:00:53.742749+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

For example , kalau lepas solat dia memang akan duduk kat sejadah and doa while aku kalau lepas solat kadang terus lipat sejadah and buat kerja . Pastu kalau waktu puasa , every night dia pergi surau solat tarawih while aku duduk bilik buat hw.

{"id": "1li9yu8", "title": "TARUMT rant (pls stay away from this college)", "content": "Here, I have list down all the mojor problems I have faced in TARUMT hoping to help anyone considering this university as a choice.\n\nI am aware that this is long if you couldn't read through all, atleast read the 6th one. Thanks.\n\n\n\nI'm a Diploma in IT student here in TARUMT(KL campus) starting my 4th year(yes, 4th for diploma). I joined this college because everyone said it was good. Not even a sem later and I realised people didn't know anuthing about this uni. This uni actually sucks and being Indian(can't speak Chinese) made it worse.\n\nFirst, I'll go over some good things here. The students are friendly. The club activities are quite active. The campus is big with enough facilities. And thats it.\n\nHere are the problems I have faced:\n\n1. Parking\n\n\\-Every Tarcian who driven to college can relate to this. Parking is a huge problem. Its impossible to find parking even if you have the campus parking sticker. First of all the campus parking sticker application chooses randomly not first-come-first-serve basis. As, someone who didn't get the sticker I had to park outside. Sometimes I'm at campus as early as 6 am just to find parking, even if my class is at 11am. Prepared to get saman if you didn't park in the yellow line (happens atleast once a week if you do it everyday). The saman officers are surely enjoying the money this college brings to them.\n\n2. Language barrier\n\n\\-Due to the overpopulation of chinese in this college almost everything is dont in Chinese. The events I attended were all conducted in Chinese and some offered interpreter while for others I needed to ask my friend who is a banana which didn't help much. \n\n\\-Even lectureres/tutors comduct lectures/classes in Chinese. Although not all a great amount of them do. Some will explain the same thing again in english and others wouldn't even bother.\n\n\\-Everything in the whatsapp group is also in Chinese. The student group was basically filled with messages in Chinese from 100-500+ perday. I can't translate all and missed up on the rarely important message(which was also in Chinese) in that pile. I missed out on my internship final report submition date thanks to this but still managed to submit it 1 week overdue(and I did pass).\n\n3. Subject structure\n\n\\- I had to study C, HTMl, CSS and JavaScript on my first sem there. At this point I was new to the world of IT and had 0 experience coding.\n\n\\-And every other sem got worse. The 2nd and intern sem was not bad because they were short. However, on the other sems, we were studying from 3-4 programming languages per sem and still had other subjects. One of the sems had us taking 7 subjects.\n\n\\-I failed most of my coding related papers because of not being able to keep up. Having ADHD made things worse for me.\n\n4. Lecturers/Tutors\n\n\\-Problem 1 is the language thing mentioned above\n\n\\-Other than that, most of the tutors are part-times. This resulted to constand class cancellation and replacement, classes on Saturdays and night classes.\n\n\\-Tutors(PT or FT) and Lecturers are like doing a gacha. You won't know if you will get a good one or bad one. I did get some(like 2-4 good tutors/lecturers) while others are just bad. The other suck or just won't help you. Some have the great knowlege but are just bad teachers (they can't teach well).\n\n\\-And then there was this one Lecturer, she was our Intro to Cybersecurity lecturer. Her teaching time reduced as time went on from 1h 50mins on first week to 30mins to 15mins on 7th week and this continued till the 14th(last) week.\n\n5. Mangement\n\n\\-They don't care. \n\n\\-At the end of every sem we wouldn't have to rate of lecturers and tutors based of few aspects and the Cybersecurity lecturer mentioned above was rated very low buy almost everyone on my sem and no action was taken she still teaches and was being reported every sem(I know cause I talk to my juniors).\n\n\\-Even the Student Representative Counsil is not respected by the management. The SRC has made many reports and they management would not take any action. This is until the SRC calls the media. When NEWS channels arrive suddently the management cares. Some cases involves(a guy taking inappropriate pictures of a girl during a college event, a twitter/X account dedicated to posting campus girls pics, and many more). These issues were only resolved because the SRC threatened to call NEWS media and sometimes actions were not taken until it becomes viral.\n\n6. A possibly rare issue that I'm facing right noow\n\n\\-On My 1st yr 3rd sem, I decided to drop a subject due to academic load and to finish my resit papers. Before dropping I asked my friends, seniors and even the academic advisor who was appointed to me if I would be required to take the subject or will they just remove it from my cert or something. This sounds stupid but at the time I was still new to college environment and didn't wanna assume how things works. My friends and seniors didn't know about it and my academic advisor was telling me to go to this and that department(How would you not know something this simple if you are working there). The due date of registration also came and I had no answer so I decided to drop it. Few weeks later I was told I would need to take that subject. I was ok with it since I can take it my my 2nd yr 3rd sem.\n\n\\-On 2nd yr 3rd sem I was not allowed to take it because I had too many subjects( these were all main subjects and not resit/repeat). However, I didn't worry much since I was extending a yr anyways to finish my resits and can take it on yr3 sem3.\n\n\\-After my finals on 2nd yr 3rd sem, I went on a trip overseas and during that times got an email(which I didn'y check thx to the trip). The email had a list of subjects that had their course code changed which included the subject I droped. So, now I have to take the same subject with the new course code instead but they did change it from yr3 sem3 to sem1. Since I was overseas till 1 week after my sem started I registered my resits during my trip. However, I didn't register the dropped subject because I didn't know about the change. After returning home, I found out about the change and was furious because the registration period was over and I would have to extend till yr4 sem1 now. However, I still accepted it and continued with my resits and finished them.\n\n\\-Now 1 week before my 4th yr sem 1 starts I got a notification on subject and which sem I can take it on. And they changed it again not it is 2nd and 3rd sem. I was planning to finish this subject this sem and start my degree in a diffrent uni on November this year. Thanks to my college's need to change things constantly, I would be stuck here till The December atleast and would have to wait until next year March or even worse July to start my degree.\n\n\\-Note the course code change didn't change the subject aspects as the same final exam papers from the previous course code were reused in the new one(like copy paste not inspired or stuff).\n\n  \n7. Final thoughts\n\n\\-I think this college sucks.\n\n\\-There are always complaints about lectures and management and stuff from many other. However, these are all fine but if a uni is screwing you over with constand changes with subjects and stuff you should just stay away. You can't study you way out of this.", "score": 114, "num_comments": 57, "created_utc": 1750662036.0, "created_date": "2025-06-23T07:00:36+00:00", "author": "DrM1h4wk", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1li9yu8/tarumt_rant_pls_stay_away_from_this_college/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:01:07.941886+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

You can also look at trends but you gotta make sure you're coming up to the peak of a trend not when it's ending.\n\nLastly, I your packaging is also really important.

I'm not really sure how to start this, but I just needed a place to let this out.\n\nI’ve never been academically gifted. There are only a few subjects where I truly feel like I shine — English, Literature, Finance, Marketing, etc.. But despite that, I chose to pursue Accounting, not because I was forced to, but because I genuinely *love* it. I have big dreams tied to it.\n\nStill, it’s been an uphill battle.\n\nSince primary school, maths has never been my strong suit — I used to hate it, honestly. That struggle followed me into secondary school and now, university. I’ve already failed Quantitative Studies twice. And despite giving everything I had — staying up late, revising until my body gave out, pushing myself through exhaustion — I still failed. My academic status is now on probation.\n\nWhat hurts more is the internal conflict. **My family isn’t the kind to push me too hard or demand straight A's**. But I had my own image of myself: someone who excelled, quietly stood out, and always had her life together. That image is shattered now, and I don’t know who I am anymore.\n\nLately, I’ve stopped eating properly — just small bites here and there when I have to. My body feels exhausted. My mind’s scattered. I can’t think clearly. I’m tired, lost, and completely burnt out.\n\nRight now, the only things keeping me grounded are my faith and my family. But I won’t lie — I’ve been having thoughts I’m not proud of. I don’t want to do anything stupid. I just needed to say this out loud. To feel like someone is listening.\n\nThanks for reading.", "score": 81, "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": 1750564840.0, "created_date": "2025-06-22T04:00:40+00:00", "author": "UnusualUnicorn04", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lhev3d/i_gave_my_all_and_in_return_i_lost_my_own/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:01:31.902212+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

{"id": "mz2x2fa", "title": "Comment on: question abt asasi...", "content": "Hii, I recently finished my asasi of 2 sems and as someone who's a slow learner and gets distracted veeery easily (idk I probably have adhd too, gna get diagnosed for that soon)\n\nI can assure you that asasi is not hard as long as you put the effort into making your own notes (during and after the lecture is good) or study the chapters first before the class starts so you won't feel dumbfounded when the lecturer starts teaching. Anything you don't understand, ASK. Ask your lecturer, it's their job to explain so don't be scared. They won't judge you. Or if you have friends that are smart, study with them. Seriously.\n\nPlus, in asasi you will have individual and group assignments too. Make sure to do your part, and if you get groupmates that don't cooperate even after you remind them so many times, just report to the lecturer personally as it will affect your marks if the assignment isn't done well. Make sure to follow all instructions given too! But for me personally assignments help a lot as I sucked at my exams, so don't waste a single mark on it if you can. \n\nAnd also, pleaaaasee score and take your exams seriously especially for the 1st semester. I got a 3.92 cgpa for my first but I don't think I'll score well for 2nd semester cuz of how harder the subjects are compared to the 1st sem but it worries me less since I don't have to score a lot (probably 3.5 for 2nd sem is enough to give me 3.7 for overall GPA when the 2 semester results combine)\n\nI have a friend who didn't take the 1st semester seriously and he only got 2.95 so he was stressing very hard for the 2nd semester.\n\nOverall, asasi is definitely easier than stpm and matriks or A-Levels but you must not take it too lightly either. In the end, all you efforts will pay off.\n\nGood luck OP!", "score": 5, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750555208.0, "created_date": "2025-06-22T01:20:08+00:00", "author": "ou7k4st", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lhbpqb/question_abt_asasi/mz2x2fa/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:01:35.055827+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lhbpqb"}
{"id": "mz2ylmm", "title": "Comment on: question abt asasi...", "content": "and yes, owning a laptop is important as you will need it to do assignments. Having a tablet or ipad to write notes on are convenient too, but it's not necessary and I don't have them myself and I did pretty well still.\n\nTo prepare for muet, try speaking in English with the people around you more if you don't do so normally. Read about a lot current issues as you can use it for your points in your speaking test. Personally, my reading and writing test were very bad but that's mostly because I suck at transferring information and was lazy to do a lot of exercises. For writing, I'm not an avid reader so my vocabulary and ideas were quite limited. So yeah, try to do more exercises and read more stuff to expand your vocabulary. Do past year questions or ask your seniors who have taken muet to give you tips. \n\nStudying in uni is different from studying in school cuz everything you do is by yourself. Most lecturers will not push you or give you extra notes like how your teachers in middle school did. Their only job is to give lectures and assist you with your assignments. But of course, you can still ask them questions if you don't understand and most of them are actually nice enough to explain further too. My lecturer did extra classes for us cuz she knew we were struggling with Accounting. But some lecturers are not so dedicated or are busy and will only tell you to revise the slides/notes that they have already given.\n\nStudying with friends is a good thing, especially if those friends push you to be better instead of dragging you down to fail. Pick your friends wisely too and don't get into relationships if possible. Since Asasi is only for 1 year, you shouldn't add more stress to your plate by having toxic people in your lives. Always protect your peace.\n\nand most importantly, protect your mental wellbeing and your health. Don't skip any classes unless you really need to. Don't make the same mistakes like I did, sem 2 is draining and I let my emotions take the best of me so I didn't perform well this time.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750555786.0, "created_date": "2025-06-22T01:29:46+00:00", "author": "ou7k4st", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lhbpqb/question_abt_asasi/mz2ylmm/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:01:35.059662+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lhbpqb"}

So even if you don't seem to like the field, you can consider for another field bcs you got options and plenty of time now. \n\nHowever, it's gonna be a tough journey bcs the students are gonna be all excellent kids gathered in one place. But it will prepare you for life. Sure, it will be pricey, but look for more financial aids before scholarships result come out. Your state should also have some sort of monetary reward for excellent SPM leavers. During my time, i didnt know, but after leaving degree, i got mine for first-class graduates.\n\nIf you go for IPG, due to financial concerns, added with the fact you're not interested in teaching in the first place, if you decided to bail one day, it will be a loss for you; your time, effort, money spent on day to day spending, books and materials etc. Saying this because 5 years is a long time and deciding to commit to such a thing when you're barely 18 is tough. And the financial support they provide also won't be that much in the end tho. \n\nAnd if im not mistaken (correct me if I'm wrong), most ipg leavers would be posted to SK instead of SMK. It will be a headache, especially if it's already not your passion. Because teaching just isn't for anyone! You gotta love it truly first, or else you become like those abusive teachers you see at schools.\n\nFor TESL, despite it being a popular field these days, im gonna be honest with you, think it through. Im a TESL graduate myself, but i think it's not really a marketable degree. You are not equipped with the skills for any other job except teaching. Some of my friends are in corporate, but these are people who found out that teaching children is not their passion later on and they were really lucky to land a reputable corporate job too. After graduating, looking for a job was hard for me due to this. Buttt if you have a decent, bright personality, then it's another case. Cus you can explore just about any job that deals with people and public. Im sure you have looked up the prospect career for TESL, right so you should know.\n\nGenuinely wishing you the best. Also, please don't feel like you are limited right now. You're very bright and brilliant, and have a wonderful future ahead of you. Don't be scared of trying and failing.

Better not because you might regret and can't bail out. You're only 18 yo, you can figure things out slowly, at least during/after your 1 year foundation you will be in a much better position to decide what path you want to take/interested in. So better keep your options open. Moreover from your post you already stated you have passion for accounting, and prefer the first option. You might just be seeking reassurance for your first choice, if you need it, let this post be your assurance. \n\nJust an advice, don't just go for what your parents like, it's your life and he will also like you to chose what is best for you (I hope so). Better chose what your heart wants instead of based on other's expectations on you.

{"id": "1lgnxmn", "title": "Is a diploma a bad thing to consider for your upper studies after SPM ??", "content": "Before discussing the issue I faced, let me briefly outline my background. In secondary school, I was a DLP student who studied science and maths in English. Later on, when entering Form 4, I got selected to study in a pure science class, which I was not interested in. I tried my best to send Google Forms to change my class, and yet they didn't respond to my request. A few teachers came to me and said I had no choice cause the class I wanted to study was cs class, but it's full so I can't be added. So I have no choice but to stay in a pure science class. After finishing my SPM the result came out with 6As and all B+ and C+. I am grateful for what I did since I got all the credits in my hand and wanted to study cs later on.\n\nI applied for matriculation, but I didn't get it, unfortunately. Then applied for UPU and the result came out. \n\nI received an offer from the Polytechnic to pursue a diploma in Information Technology. Some of my friends got the same course offer from different institutions, but they didn't accept it just because it's a diploma, and also cause of poli. When I got the offer, I was so happy and grateful because, as a student who was stuck in the science stream and didn't get the class I wanted in SMK, I really appreciated the fact that I got an offer to do a dip in IT. The reason I was grateful was that before getting my UPU results and SPM results, I was learning how to code and do programming so I could be a little advanced in that particular stage of my upper studies and upgrade myself more there.\n\nLater on, my friends and I were discussing the offer we got and we were happy for each other since they got what they wanted. Two of them got asasi in Sains Hayat, and there are three other friends I know who got diploma, but in different majors. When I asked them did they accepted it, they immediately said \"Ain't no way it's a diploma\" and \"It's over two years and a waste of years\". You see I'm a person who gives advice to people who will actually take it, but these types of people I know I can't give them cause they ain't gonna take it, so I ain't gonna waste my energy convincing them to take it. Since it's their life, up to them. \n\nWhen it was around my turn to tell them what offers I got, they convinced me, saying \"No, your life just gonna get wasted\" and \"Poli is ain't good or dip something you shouldn't consider\". I just nodded and said okay. I kept my mouth shut, saying nothing, just listening to their little advice that doesn't make sense. I met a few friends in form 6 before getting my upu result, my classmate said she don't want poli because it's not good or not suitable for upper studies. \n\nWhat's wrong with studying in poli or accepting a dip offer? I'm not confused by these people because I know what I'm doing, and I'm the one going to study in the future. People do come around and say this is bad, that is bad. I do listened to my parents advice before accepting these offer i get from poli, they were happy and they asked me \"are you okey with this offer\" i said yes immediately because if i said no the only option is to further my study in a private uni, and i have no intentions to burden my parents to pay my tuition fees. It doesn't matter if they have money or not, I would never accept myself to ask them for money for my studies when I can study somewhere cheaper without burdening my parents. \n\nI did a background check on the poli I got, and it's a well-known poli when it comes to tech fields. Not only that, I checked the facilities there, the place to stay, and the environment, most importantly, I came across ex-students who studied in the poli and got an offer to study abroad, and the feedback from them about the poli. This is already a good offer for me, and I can't bring myself to decline it. Love to accept the offer without a heavy heart nor forced by anyone.\n\nSo yeah, what are your thoughts on these types of people having old mindsets till now?", "score": 7, "num_comments": 18, "created_utc": 1750480040.0, "created_date": "2025-06-21T04:27:20+00:00", "author": "Unusual_Rest5489", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lgnxmn/is_a_diploma_a_bad_thing_to_consider_for_your/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:01:50.327970+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

{"id": "myx4nes", "title": "Comment on: AM I FAILED?...", "content": "Sorry to hear about your situation. Malaysia is like this, even though UPU practices 'meritocracy since 20 years ago' like what Malays like to champion about, UPU actually still has quota for lepasan SPM, meaning, asasi and diploma has quota.\n\n I was lepasan SPM 2023, merit UPU 95.34%, and put asasi UUM for 1st choice, asasi UUM for my batch has a purata merit of 90.24% (meaning kids in my batch that enter asasi UUM have around 90% merit, atleast, for bumiputera kids), didn't get it despite having 5% higher merit. Asasi that are open to nons have a hidden quota, the nons that get asasi usually need atleast 8A+ to have a realistic chance to get it like AsasiPintar, ASPER, Asasi UUM, Asasi UPNM, etc. other asasi like PASUM, UiTM, UNIMAS, UMS are for bumiputera only.\n\nBased on KPTM kenyataan, the total asasi students in a batch is like around 4k or something (could be 2k or 3k, i dont remember the exact number), and the non bumis are only 50 of them, other are bumis. \n\nMatriks is self explanatory, 10% non, 90% bumi. \n\nThen race quota doesn't exactly exist for lepasan STPM/setaraf, but rather it sets nons to systematically fail via merit. Matrics and asasi students easily get 100 merit, whereas STPM students which majority being nons, even if they're really smart (4.0 students), very active and high achiever in koko like can represent their own state, they'd at max probably get 99% merit, losing to thousands of  asasi and matric students in UPU. Hence, impossible to compete for nons being in STPM. This is how the quota works, set up quota for pra-u, make nons systematically fail, champion there's no quota for UPU which is only half truth, anyone who understands how UPU works knows the quota still exists for pra-u level that affects the path to degree. This is just the unfortunate reality for nons in Malaysia. I've seen posts on Threads where a 5-6A bumi got ASPER, while i see people who successfully get ASPER on xiaohongshu/RedNote has atleast 8A+. \n\nThis is why braindrain is a very serious problem, the smart nons are migrating, political situation is getting worse, we don't have competent parties in our politics, Malaysia is in a recession right now with a bunch of taxes recently introduced. Malaysia is going to a shithole, and in 10-20 years if this doesn't get fixed, Malaysia would be a shithole whereas other countries have alot of new contributions thanks to the talents of Malaysia migrating away.\n\nMy advice, continue with STPM, no other choices, really. Unless your family can afford you to IPTS. IPTS does have scholarships, you can look into it if you're interested.

{"id": "1lfyosw", "title": "UM, IIUM, and UUM LLB Interview Experience", "content": "Just finished my last interview today for UM and thought I'd share each experience for any prospective students after me! This will vary wildly for diff people though since I'm from Sarawak and did all my interviews online.\n\n\\-\n\n***UUM***\n\nMy first interview! It was conducted as a group interview (4 candidates to 2 lecturers) and it was honestly pretty chill. I think they grouped similar candidates together because all 4 of us were STPM graduates. Total time was about an hour long so that's roughly 10-15 mins speaking time for each candidate?\n\nThey only asked 3 questions:-\n\n1. Introduce yourself, your pre-U course, what subjects you took, your choices for UPU and why is UUM your nth choice?\n2. Why do you want to take law/Is there a singular event that triggered your want to study law?\n3. Why UUM? Are you ready to move to Kedah for your studies? (since all 4 of us were from East Malaysia haha)\n\n***IIUM***\n\nFor IIUM, I think most interviews were done in-person, but it was Gawai season for us EMs, so I had to email and call their Student Affairs Department to reschedule. (Sidenote: IIUM's staff is really kind and patient!! Everyone I spoke to was so nice and understanding.) The IIUM online interview was also a group session; I was with 4 other candidates. 2 of us were from Sarawak, but the other 3 were international students. There was a whopping 4/5 lecturers interviewing us though LOL\n\nThe interview is less structured than UUM or UM; it's more of the lecturers playing by ear. There were two parts:-\n\n1. Personal background:-\n   * Introduce yourself, why you want to study Law, and why did you pick IIUM?\n   * Then, they'd ask you more questions after listening to your answer. For example, I said I wanted to study at IIUM bc it's a new environment for me, I like the uni's philosophy of education, etc. One of the lecturers then asked me to elaborate on my 2nd point.\n2. General knowledge:-\n   * They personalise the questions based on the candidate.\n   * They asked 1 of them their view on the Madleen (aid flotilla) being captured by Israelis and whether it was legal\n   * Another was asked whether Modi (India's PM) was justified in attacking Pakistan(?? IIRC)\n   * The two Sarawakians were asked about PETROS and PETRONAS, i.e. \"Do you think natural resources should belong to the Federal or State Government?\"\n\n***UM***\n\nLast interview! This one is held on a 2-lecturer-to-1-candidate basis, but I had another friend also undergoing the IV at the same time to me, so I can compare. My friend's interview was pretty standard according to the rest of the internet: they asked her to introduce herself, why she wanted to be a lawyer, and then gave her a mock trial question (3 minute lawyer).\n\nMine was slightly different, probably because I talked too much lollllllll. They asked me to introduce myself, and why I wanted to be a lawyer. I told them abt my passion to ensure stateless children receive citizenship and the rights that come with it (paraphrasing), so they asked me instead about statelessness. They also asked me something like \"I see UM is your first choice, what were your 2nd, 3rd and 4th choices?\"\n\nOne of the lecturers asked \"The main argument against giving stateless persons citizenship is whether it's a concern for national security; as an MP, what solution would you give?\" I said we would give them citizenship tests when they turned 18 like how expatriates are expected to undergo, like speaking BM and singing the national anthem (IDK brother I panicked). She asked again: \"But how would you ensure that people dont come to Malaysia just to give birth and give their children citizenship?\" or something along those lines.\n\nThey're looking to attack your ideas and see how you react under pressure, so just stick to your OG point and argue it out. These are the markings of a true lawyer! (JK)\n\n\\-\n\nTake all these with a grain of salt, since it's going to be diff for everyone.

Lecturers love STPM graduates because of their experience in doing their own research, no need to teach what to do for assignments (references, plagiarism, etc.).", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750429551.0, "created_date": "2025-06-20T14:25:51+00:00", "author": "BallEater010", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lfwutd/stpm_or_asasi_satu/mytfd9h/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:02:19.636492+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lfwutd"}

{"id": "1lfvywb", "title": "Opinions & Thoughts", "content": "Hey everyone, I'm a SPM 2024 graduate and will soon be living my college life.\n\nI have alot in mind that's really bothering me and just making me restless for the whole day.\n\nIm a science stream student. Of course people would expect you to take a course in engineering,doctors or something similar in the spectrum of what i learned in my high school.\n\nAt first, that's what i thought too. I wanted to take chem eng because well yeah. (OnG = High Pay,Goyang kaki and all)\n\nBut i was really busy back then and didn't even bothered to really have the time to research what chem eng was really about.\n\nAlso along the way,i applied my matriks and put engineering as my first choice and accounting as my 2nd. \n\nAfter i got my spm results, my results were okay (7A 2B). And this makes me more determined and more eager to pursue in chem eng because i had solid enough results. I chose \"kejuruteraan kimia\" in uthm as my first choice and put other courses like tesl, accounting,and all that in my upu application.\n\nWeeks gone by,and i got an offer from matriculation. It was accounting. But atp,i didn't really put my thought about it because i had this thinking of \"me science student no accounting, accounting bad\". And people around me like my family really pushed me into this engineering courses.\n\nBut somewhere along the way,i had my self reflection. It's like my consciousness just got  activated. I asked myself  \"do i really want to do this?\" \n\nI look back to my high school years and replay my journey. Yes, I might've got good results for my stem subjects. But i felt like i was forced to like it. (Like in a toxic relationship) I was able to to endure it because i had good support from my teachers, family and friends that are always there to motivate me and walk the spm journey together. But when in college/uni?, there's no certainty that I can cope it.\n\nThen, i was hanging out with my friends,just having a great time together and all. Just doing your teenage life. After that,we went to eat together and i happened to ask him a question. \"Kau rasa aku sesuai engineering ke tukar masuk akaun?\"\n\nAt first he gave me neutral answers like \"ohh ikut minat la\" something like dat.\n\nBut then he told me \"Tapi kalau aku tengok lah,aku prefer kau masuk accounting. Yelah,masa kau nak belajar subjek stem semua. Nampak kau struggle untuk tangkap concept. Tapi bila masuk subjek yang number heavy mcm math or addmath kau boleh catchup quickly and lebih semangat nak jawab. Walaupun susah,kau tetap jugak semangat & determined cari jawapan\"\n\n(cringe anime motivation ahh talk)\n\nBut it really hits me. I guess he's right. I enjoy doing math and addmath more than i do than subjects like bio,chem,and physics.\n\nAnd that's when my interest sudden to shift towards accounting.\n\nI went back home,i told my dad abt it. And my dad said he's okay with it as long as it's still a job,he wouldn't care. He just wants the best from me.\n\n\nRecently,upu has announced it results. And i got chem eng in ums. Ums?? I didn't apply for ums for my upu. And the course selection is still chem eng. This leaves me with a huge dilemma in my mind. Should i continue my chem eng or change my course to accounting?\n\n\nabang ii and akak ii senior sekalian,show me ur wisdom,and give some tips too if you guys can 🙏🙏🙏\n\nThat's all for my ramblings.", "score": 7, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1750397002.0, "created_date": "2025-06-20T05:23:22+00:00", "author": "Alert_Childhood8188", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lfvywb/opinions_thoughts/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:02:19.745506+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

Are you questioning your decision because of your passion or because you think it's hard to do chem engineering? because lowkey it sounded like you're backing up from doing chem engineering because of no support, no confidence.\n\nFor someone who has a bit of acc background, it is not about maths. Yes, it involves mathematics but very basics, and most of it is theory. If you're more into numbers, actuarial science seems like a better choice, but you're a bit late to choose that.\n\nI can't tell you what to choose since I'm not knowledgeable about chem engineering to tell you to pick which one. My suggestion is yes, to follow your passion, but please check out their study case during degree to understand what you're getting into. Search for previous students' study cases.

Why would you guys do if everyone in your group doesn't really give cooperation for assignments? Firstly, I explain the background.\n\nI have assignment due next week but the assignment is currently not moving. I have been asking since before mid break if they can divide their own part between them because in my head, I already give everything and I already started writing in the document but they don't really give me a reply other than okays. So, I thought fine, we can start early and finish early because I'm used to do that but after a while, I see that no one has written anything in the document but I want to say that I understand that they didn't write yet because we're all busy with a big class project so maybe they don't have time yet. I also text in the group during mid sem break after I consult with lecturer and I gave a suggestion on dividing the task but then again, no response. After midterm break, I ask one of them f2f why they don't reply the text and they said there's too much text and they forgot to reply. Someone from the group ask me to explain back to the group because some of them don't get it and I text in the group if there's anything they don't understand, they can ask me and I'll gladly explain it again. Someone said okay and nothing. No questions and again, I try to understand because the project is coming up and everyone is getting busier. The problem is I'm getting too tired to push them.\n\nI ask my friend and she say I should push them after the project but honestly, I'm too tired to give them face and I'm not sure how to go from here. So, should I give them another chance and let them finish it before due date or should I did it all by myself? Also, I'm thinking about reporting it to my lecturer because to me, it doesn't seem fair they got around the same mark as me since I do most of the work.

{"id": "1lf90sc", "title": "My experience in UCSI College", "content": "This post is to explain about my experience studying in UCSI College.\n\nI apologize for this long description, But I want to make things clear in here and avoid any misunderstanding that can be used against me.\n\nFirst off, I would like to explain that I am a student who did not do well in SPM. I have lulus in most of the subject, I did not reach the requirements of 3 Credits and I should have retaken my SPM.\n\nWhen UCSI College had an open day, I was introduced to a \"Business Certificate\". I was told finishing this certificate allow me to take \"Information Technology Diploma\" I was interested in.\n\nI have recently finished the \"Business Certificate\" and I went to check for the enrollment of \"Information Technology Diploma\". I was told that the \"Government rules\" have changed in 2024 and I am no longer allowed to take \"Information Technology\" BUT was allowed to take \"Information System\" which is more towards Business related rather than computer programming related.\n\nI asked why was it not mentioned in our WhatsApp group which everyone was in when it had changed in 2024? Instead I was blamed for not replying to their text regarding my continuation for diploma (Which was already midway through 2025). One of them said \"why don't I just retake SPM now?\"\n\nI replied \"then why should I have taken this \"Business Certificate\" that have taken 2 years of my time?\n\nI took it because I was told \"Information Technology\" was allowed.\n\nThey asked me if I had attended a continuation talk in their online meeting, which I did not. I said \"I did not focus or heard it\" which was my dumb mistake; so they choose to say they mention the changes during the meeting. Even if they had said it during the meeting, It was nearly midway in 2025.\n\nThe brochure or booklet of the page that writes Education Pathway in DIPLOMA PROGRAMMES says it's either SPM/O-Level/UEC in order to continue to a few subjects including \"Information Technology\"\n\nBUT there is also another pathway that says \"Certificate in relevant field\". I asked them regarding this and why it was written so \"vaguely\", they said I needed to take \"Certificate in Information Technology\" which I was confused as I was not told during the time when I joined the college.\n\nEven if the rules had changed, We were not told of this and this should not have affected us as we were told that we were allowed to take Information Technology at the time of our enrollment for \"Business Certificate\". If the changes had been made during 2024, Then we should have been properly informed through our WhatsApp group giving us more time to consider if this was the proper choice for us to continue our studies.\n\nThe confrontation between me and them became an argument soon when I pointed out why we were not told during 2024 when changes were made which they did not answer.\n\nWhat I wanted was not an argument and rather a proper explanation of why we were not informed earlier when things were changed. Everyone should have been informed immediately if things were to be changed during that time and it should have been made very clearly to the students who are studying there.\n\nThis had made me feel like I have been lied to by the college regarding this issue and they just replied with \"ok\".\n\nI am posting this to explain my experience studying in this college. My goal is not to look for an argument rather a clear explanation if it truly was a mistake.\n\nBut I feel this college was not respectful when I bought this situation with them especially when things turned into an argument. I brought up with them hoping for a simple \"I'm sorry but the situation have changed, We should have mention it earlier and it was our mistake; Is there anything we can do to help you on this path\" Instead I was met with a very defensive argument unwilling to accept their mistakes.\n\nI am writing this post is because I hope who ever reads this will be more cautious when choosing their diploma or degree path in a college and they are willing to make excuses or lie about it in order to get that commission fee.\n\nAnyways, I hope this will help people to be more cautious when choosing their college courses.\n\nI don't mind if people blame me for doing bad in SPM or not retaking it rather than risking it in a college certificate that apparently is not guarantee.", "score": 19, "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": 1750334476.0, "created_date": "2025-06-19T12:01:16+00:00", "author": "FuturisticPikacuYT", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lf90sc/my_experience_in_ucsi_college/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:02:40.013244+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

It is great that you have visited our campus and liked it, although it is located in the middle of nowhere and traveling anywhere outside of the campus is extremely inconvenience.\n\nDuring my time (I am unsure if this is still true), the first semester new students cannot choose their own village and were auto assigned to wherever empty. V1 and V2 are the oldest and cheapest hostel, V3 V4 V5 are best (relatively), and V6 is like living in the jungle. There is also a brand new V7 finishing soon later this year. However, do not worry as for chemical engineering, our blocks (Block 3, 4, 5) are located far from all hostels lol. As for mosque, V6 would be the nearest but V6 is only open for boys.\n\nFood wise, all foods sold in UTP are halal. Variety may be limited, as most are malay, 1 stall malaysian chinese style (halal again), and 1 pakistani/arabic. \n\nCant say how hard CE is comparatively, but I can say that we are group project and assignment heavy. Back in my days I would do assignments and projects every night and sleep after 12am at the earliest. Countless nights without sleep. However this was in the era where we are auto assigned the group members and they purposely mixed members of different grades, so we kind of forced to carry the weaker students. Time has changed for good.\n\nLecturers wise, CE dept generally has good lecturers, albeit some specific literal trashes that I wont name here.

{"id": "mylskkb", "title": "Comment on: Form 6 or Politeknik?...", "content": "As a politeknik student who is now in UM, i feel very out of place due to the 1 or 2 years age gap among batchmates. Majority of the students here are from Matrix, small percentage from From 6 and even smaller percentage  from Poli. For my course i only met 3 other people from poli, that also we all from different polis. You can imagine during orientation, everyone having fun meeting familiar faces, and you're the only stranger among everyone else. I know it's part of life to meet new people, but it feel odd. Even in class, matrix or asasi students prefer to group with their friends for group assignment and you're gonna have to team with other strangers or international students with you don't know for sure they have the same dedication. (no hate to international students, but sometimes communication and cultural barriers make it difficult for us to work together). Now you may think that i myself is the problem for not stepping out of you comfort zone, to be willing to meet new people. When each class and tutorial session you heave to introduce yourself just to the person sitting next to you, its going to take a tole on your mentality. You start doubting yourself am i that out of place in society for getting a diploma then only a degree. Overtime i got use to it and kept an open mind because sometime people make fun of your age intentionally or unintentionally. I constantly got to remind myself, it was always my choice to get a diploma, i have to live by my decision. Life in UM is easier now, because if you cannot get friends in the faculty, there's always residential colleges and clubs where you can meet people with same passion. Age is still a problem but at least competition against each other is not as intense as in the faculty. \n\nIn short, if i were given a chance to rewind time, i think i would have gone for form 6. I tried applying for matrix after SPM, unfortunately 9As is just not good enough. In my experience, it's more enjoyable to be a form 6 student than a poli student in uni. Of course i dont regret my time as a poli student.

Regarding fee payment or any overall campus experience? \n\nAre there too many unjustified fees that seem to be miscellaneous yet adding up? \nIs it financially pressing for the average person to study in APU? although it is a litter higher than public universities, its certainly an intermediate in comparison to Taylors and Sunway maybe? \n\n\nTo be more specific:  \n1. Are there any semester-wise miscellaneous fees (resource, exam, insurance, student services, etc.)? \n \n2. Any annual fees for international student management or medical insurance\n\n3. Any hidden charges or other costs students are expected to cover during the course\n\n4. APU university dorm experience (better to live in the dorms or someplace nearby?)\n\n5. Also, how likely is failing or repeating a subject that gets you behind your peers for months? I would like to finish my major in the designated time, or atleast 6-12 months more if i were to consider worse case scenario. \n\nAlso, i want to provide some context, ive decided to join APU university instead of Universiti Malaya. i think the competitiveness in UM is too much to bear for me personally, alumnis usually take longer than expected to graduate.

What kind of degree that Swinburne offers that unimas doesn't? And vice versa. Does the degree that you want is offered at both unis or either of them? If you're not sure yet on which to pursue, you can do an in-depth search on the degree options. Or, if you want to keep your options open for now/not really particular on what degree you what, you can do a comparison on the uni experience. Ada je orang post pasal Swinburne dgn unimas dekat subreddit ni. Tiktok and Instagram also got.

I handled around RM1.8k-2.5k in total, with group members sending me money for mock sales, reimbursements, etc. It was nothing illegal or dodgy — literally just for class. I even added payment references like \"APK reimbursement\" to show it was for uni.\n\nApparently, the inconsistent inflow/outflow  triggered their system since it didn't match my unemployed status. Which I offered to provide proof that this was for a university assignment, but they said it didn’t matter because the activity technically classifies as “business” and personal accounts can’t be used for that. Perhaps it was my fault for using personal bank for this and I should've done my own research but I wasn't aware of any of this happening at all..\n\nNow:\n* My account is being shut down.\n* The person also mentioned that I will be put on hold in the future if I ever wanted to open a public bank account again \n\nI'm worried:\n* Will this affect my ability to open accounts with other banks?\n* Could it impact my future credit score or job prospects?\n* Should I escalate this to Bank Negara or is that too much?\n\nI'm staying in Sabah at this moment and I wont be able to go directly to the bank that I opened my account too.

At the end, I only scored C+ in Bio, D in chem and i failed addmaths. I was pretty letdown because i put in a lot of effort. but i wanted to still continue in science somehow, but i wasn’t accepted in form 6 science obviously since i failed addmaths and D in chem. and for UPU, i didn’t put any other choices other than science choices and i got rejected from all 6 unis i applied to. i joined form 6 in sains sosial temporarily and right now i’m so lost.

I saw some tiktok comments of people who went there saying that i am not gonna have a uni life and that it feels like tuition. This is a problem because i really really want that precious uni life and the fact that im going to waste my little teen years left at that place is saddening and depressing to me.\n\nI noticed families from both side of my parents wants me to study overseas so im thinking I'll do that for my mbbs or degree since it'll also compensate for my missing uni life, and bc i myself also wanna go overseas. So how does one with my diploma go overseas for mbbs ? I've been hearing a lot of people telling me about mahsa. I know the money needed for mahsa (or any mbbs i think?) is a lot but since I'll be a doctor and make doctor money, i figured that doesn't matter since I'll be rich, right ? And also, scholarships exist right ?\n\nIf i dont do that good in my diploma somehow im thinking of doing offshore medic for 2 years since my diploma and some certificates is perfect for that, and ik they make banks.\n\nI just wanna be great.\n\nIm also open to other degree that can make me go overseas that can also make me a lot of money. I did too much research about my future and I've been thinking about it too much. My diploma allows me to have a lot of choices for my degree.\n\nSo anyway again, how does one with my diploma go overseas so that i can have a uni life and satisfy both my parents families and pls tell me about scholarships for going overseas and such 🙏\n\nI don't mind having a degree uni life in Malaysia as well, but ofc overseas sounds better doesn't it.\n\n\n\nSo anyway how does my plan sound ?

{"id": "1lec4nv", "title": "Help me idk what to do", "content": "Hi! First time here.\n\nJust a little background story: my interests are all over the place. That’s why from what you’re going to read soon, it’s literally like opposite ends of each spectrum. (It’s a brain dump) \n\nMy questions are should I try to rayu for KPM or accept poli or stick with KPTM?\n\nAfter getting my SPM results, I got an offer for a Diploma in Business Management (DBM) at KPTM. For my UPU, I applied for Diploma in International Business (DIB) [KPM], Diploma in Business Studies (DBS) [KPM] and a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in petrochemical (DPC)[politeknik]. Those are the only ones I remember applying for lol and I when I got my results back, I got a DPC.\n\nPreferably, I want KPM since it’s free and I’m lowkey interested in the international business course (but I didn’t get an offer). With KPTM, the tuition fees are the exact same as if I went private. On the other hand, I’m also interested in engineering. From what I’ve read so far, people don’t really recommend girls going into mechanical engineering because usually they don’t really hire women and I really don’t want to study for so long for me just to not work in my field. \n\nI’ve joined those livestreams of the KPTM students encouraging people to join but from what I’ve read, they are getting paid to do so and I’m not sure if I should trust it or not.\nPoli pulak, there’s not much information about that course and Ive looked into the subject so far, the one I’m most hesitant about is Engineering math. The reason being is I didn’t pass addmath for spm and most of it looks like addmath.\n\nMy mum encouraged me to apply for business (she was a business major herself) because she said it is not as difficult and it would be easier since I don’t know what I like and at least I wouldn’t suffer as hard in comparison to me taking STEM. \n\nHelp me out pls. I don’t know who to talk to anymore.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nIm going down the business route.\n\nHi, yesterday I had a lengthy conversation about this with people who had experience with the Poli environment. He gave me the option of just accepting the Poli offer, enter for 1 sem to feel out the engineering route and see how it is and if I don’t enjoy it, I can just write a letter basically saying I want to stop. From that person’s opinion, it’s the best option since I get to feel out both environments. KPTM you can apply directly so I can technically enter either the November intake or just wait till next year. Unlike Poli, I have to wait for UPU. \nWhat made me pull away from the engineering option is basically from the person’s perspective, especially in mechanical, girls in the class are probably less than 5. It would be hard for group assignments if you’re not already a part of the clique and have to work to shimmy your way into a different group. From another person’s experience, she was always pushed to do the paperwork when they do the hands on jobs. My mum doesn’t mind about the learning aspect anymore (she basically said “it’s up to you because you are the one studying.”). Now she is mostly worried about the environment and doesn’t want me to mess up my exams over my surroundings. There was more but that was just the gist of it. \n\nThank you everyone for reading and commenting. It helped me to put a few things into perspective. Hope you have a good rest of your life.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1750236483.0, "created_date": "2025-06-18T08:48:03+00:00", "author": "thr0waway9997", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lec4nv/help_me_idk_what_to_do/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:03:24.979479+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

Once you finish diploma you can further your studies in specialized degrees like logistics or international business. During your diploma, you can take time to discover which field you're interested in and can figure out your strengths and weaknesses. A lot of people underestimate how versatile a business degree is. As a business degree holder there's still a chance that you can venture into engineering related fields but you won't be one of the engineers obviously. Yeah sure the market is saturated with a lot of other new grads with business degrees but that pretty much applies to other degree holders too. That's why you gotta learn how to stand out and put yourself out there. To do that, you have the whole time at university to figure that out. \n\n\nAs for engineering, if you didn't even pass addmaths for spm then I suggest it's best to steer away from that option. I got a A in maths, D in addmath and even tho I don't take engineering (I take STEM) I still struggle with university-level maths subjects.

Sufficient for uni work? I don't do heavy gaming and just light uni work or only do some occasional YouTube streaming. Sometimes my sister might come over so that will be only maximum 2 people using the WiFi. Or should I just stick with the original times WiFi plan?

Soo the speed dont always reach 100mbps but depends on the area. If Celcomdigi network is strong there u can get higher speed as it is uncapped but the data has a limit of 1000GB per month. Its a good WiFi but it is very heavily realiant on the network strength. For the price 79/month is with a contract and you'll have to pay RM288 for the device(wifi moderm) if u want which will be discounted back into your payment monthly for 2 years (RM12/month). You will be tied to a 2 year contract. There is an option without contract which is 99/month but it comes without the device but incase you have your own you can use it. You can also terminate without any fees and any time if u choose the rm99 plan.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750237711.0, "created_date": "2025-06-18T09:08:31+00:00", "author": "FireBallAmigo_79", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1le8k0i/celcomdigi_5g_home_wifi_plan_advice/myf1pvk/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:03:31.408039+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1le8k0i"}

{"id": "1ldovns", "title": "The Truth about INTI university (Nilai)", "content": "This is going to be a long reddit text submission but thats because it needs to be comprehensive and informative as possible for the sake of future students wanting to enrol in INTI. \n\nI have compiled experiences of others, including my own that led to me dropping out of this university. The people i have talked to did NOT urge me to make this post, its purely my choice.\n\n1) Essentially a Chinese University: \nBefore i enrolled I heard that this was a \"laureate\" international uni. I had high hopes based on the marketing, web pages and all thinking ill enrol in a diverse uni with a reputable degree. Upon arrival I discovered it was bought by a local chinese man. As a result most students here are chinese who can barely speak english (but studying their courses in English) which means socialising will be hard for internationals. I need to mention that a big fraction are racist too. The common nationalities here are Indian and chinese the rest of the ethnicities account for 5% of the students.\n\n2) Scholarship Scam:\nINTi* essentially promises scholarship to every Tom Dick and Harry giving the students a delusion that they just got a good deal. This is a tactic for them to attract international students especially. I have seen students who did not even study A-levels or Foundation who get enrolled into degree straight away with a \"scholarship\". These students ended up suffering a lot during the course as they failed due to lacking/absence in foundation.\n\nAnother form of this scam is the \"appealing method\". I have beeb told by many internationals that they were promised (as well as indicated by scholarship forms) thats if their CGPA is above 2.5 in their first year they can \"appeal\" to enjoy the same scholarship in the consecutive year. This was essentially a lie. Many students got denied during their second year despite meeting the requirement; reason being \"its for locals only\" which wasnt stated explicitely anywhere. One of my friends had a cgpa of above 3.7 and above in engineering and he got denied making him demoralised. Another one had to go home amd differ the semester because being denied what was promised ruined his families whole budgeting plans.\n\n3) Student services\nA big portion of the employees in this sector as rude for no reason. I get that work can be stressful but being rude is straight up wrong. Some scold students as if this is a highschool not a university for adults. In fact one incident caused another student to make heavy losses. This happened at the international office when he submitted  his passport forvisa renewal and the employee in charge somehow messed it up. Instead of taking accountability, they scolded the student and said its his fault. They nagged him to book a ticket home ASAP and when he did they scolded him for being impatient. Hence he didnt take the flight. They went and did that AGAIN 3 MORE TIMES, wasting his money on flightless tickets. Currently he is home and decided that INTI isnt a suitable university for international students. The employee has been allegedly fired but it was wrong of the uni to wait until the damage is done to interfere.\n\nAnother incident involved a bus driver punching a local student in the face just because the student said \"thanks for parling the right spot this time\" after countless times of the bus driver being sloppy at his job. \n\n4) Sexual Assault Cases\nI have to say this is not a safe space for women. There has been an incident at a dim area near the bus stop where a girl was walking and a man ran to her, inappropriately touched her and ran away. She couldnt identify him clearly and the case was swept under the rug. The management installed a bright light which was really good but as of now the light has been turned off.\n\n\nTheres loads more to include here (such as the hostels poor state and what goes in there) but the main purpose of this post is to give a second opinion on this university. You can even check other reddit posts about this university. Make sure that you conduct proper research before enrolling in INTI", "score": 94, "num_comments": 12, "created_utc": 1750171203.0, "created_date": "2025-06-17T14:40:03+00:00", "author": "truth_speaker000001", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1ldovns/the_truth_about_inti_university_nilai/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:03:43.159795+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

Is not the same level as matriks.   \n  \nA lot of post-SPM students misjudges or misinterpret their ability to learn based on their SPM result. Knowing how to answer national standardized exam questions , rote memorization with drilling and answering techniqes does not translate to actual learning and understanding.   \n  \nYou will watch some of your friends taht scores during school years, failing and struggling in PASUM due to them treating PASUM like SPM or their innate nature or enjoying their \"liberty\" from schools system, teachers hounding them to study  and parent not knowing what they do.    \n  \nnext thing you know, its already mid sem exam (week 7) and another 7 week its final sem exam and there goes your 1st semester.  1 or 2 weeks sem break and another 7 + 7 weeks you will fill your UPU again for degree. So you can evaluate your plan to join \" 2 week programme(will not be present in campus) to boost koko\".  Thats 2 weeks of missing lectures , tutorials and study time. \n\n\"would it put too much pressure to catch up on studies?\" - it depends on your ability. maybe you are the one that is special. Remember lecturers is not teacher especially if you expect them to be like school teachers. I see alot post in this sub,  students that went on berating on their lecturer , demanding them to be more like teachers in school.  Their KPI for teaching is only 20% inclusive PASUM and otheir faculty subject. \n\nOne thing that i regret not doing is knowing my study style and less wasting time not studying. One thing that boost my understanding of subject is i will sneak into lecture to attend the lecture twice. For example if i have Calculus lecture on wednesday, i will sneak into the same lecture of a different group before/ after my lecture. That way during 2nd lecture , its just me understanding the lecture, perfecting my note. Unfortunately , i only do this duing 2nd sem while really struggling on sem 1 and getting 3.7 Asasi hayat. B- on Math(Calc and algebra) Thats is way wayyyy back before ChatGPT. \n\nWith LLM cgat GPT, i think you can have a personal tutor that is very patient , always availbale and instant feedback and not  \"sick of you\" . Make sure to prompt using specific pedagogy term like drip the content, scaffold technique, one by one , step by step, learn by practice.

This usually isn't an overnight thought and neither is deciding between matriculation and diploma. Matriculation is cheaper (And may be more difficult to some). It feels more like a boarding school than a college. However, do good and you're almost set to go for any Bachelor's degree of your choice, to an extent, overseas like how my friends did back then. This can set you up for scholarships to go overseas if you plan on that route. This is a big if because it's highly dependent on your grades once you pass. If you don't get any overseas offer, you're still likely to go to places UM, UKM, or UNIMAS.\n\n\nGoing the diploma route however, secures you a diploma certificate after you graduate which is a prerequisite to job applications. This is safer, easier to manage, and you get the feel of college. But it's more time consuming and higher cost long term which will only land you peanut paying jobs after you're done unless you further your studies to get a Bachelor's degree. \n\n\nNow if you're into computer science, IT, or something along the same field, TVET is another option. This means places like Polytechnics. Please do not listen to anything negative that people say about Polytechnics. These institutions while are riddled with many who are just in it just for the hell of it, Polytechnics produces work-ready graduates. The programmes in it are designed to prepare you for work. Some Polytechnics have IT courses which you may wanna explore as options. These are also aren't as costly as university fees. There are even multiple gov assistance on TVET. \n\n\nRule 1 is to never listen to what others tell you is best. All are equally good options if you can carry yourself as a student. There is no such thing as a programme that is useless or bad or better than the other. It all comes down to what you want, need, and aspire to be. I would suggest learning the differences between these 3 things and finding out what options there are for you that align with your interests. I'd also suggest looking into the type of assistance, grants, loans, scholarships that each of these have. \n\nEither way good luck.

(Waiting PSPM2 Results)\n\nI seperated my experience into sections, hope it helps :)\n\n>CS Syllabus\n\nIf your main goal is to get into CS as fast as possible, I do not recommend taking Matriks ***with it's current\\* CS syllabus***. ( \\* explanation at the end of this section)\n\nI took the 1 year program.\n\nI took CS (SC015 and SC025) under the Physical Science(Sains Fizikal) Package. In my experience, CS in matriks is super underwhelming, while I had some experience with programming with Python, it is still super easy to get A.\n\nIn fact, CS is regarded as a \"Free A\" subject, but I did not take it for the sake of getting a free A.\n\nFirst semester of CS is about Binary, Logic Gates, Networks, and Development Philosophy(?). It is so easy that even people with no experience with computers can get A.\n\nSecond semester of CS is on Programming and Java Programming(Unfortunately). This is the semester where most people struggle because you have to learn to write a program(on PC and Paper). While I was saved by having some programming experience, my classmates struggled on syntax, flow, like most new programming learners except they have to write everything on paper during the final exam(PSPM).\n\n**\\* BUT** the MOE is changing the CS program, where the CS Stream is purely CS focused. From what my lecturers said, we were the last batch for this CS syllabus. But if you want to try your luck on whether MOE will actually implement this change, you can go with matriks. But your argument on having to learn other subjects is still a big downside if you aim to just get into CS.\n\nBut BE AWARE that my CS Syllabus is focused on teaching CS from Zero. If you had experience with CS and you can google, you're getting that \"free\" A.\n\n>MUET\n\nYou will be guided via an English class specifically for MUET by a lecturer who is a MUET examiner. You will start your MUET exam just after your Semester 1 Exam(PSPM1) or approximately around that. So you have around 5 months MAX to prepare. 5 months sounds like a decent amount of time but it really isnt. Luckily I got a Band 5 but the average is band 4 to band 4.5.\n\n>Finances\n\nI am fortunate to not worry as much on money as my parents can support the burden of me not allowed to work (Matrics Rules) and having to buy food and necessities so I can fully focus on studies. The MOE gives almost everyone RM250 allowance each month(Last month of Sem1 and Sem2 are excluded). You simply can not survive on that puny rm250 assuming you eat 3 meals a day, do laundry(assuming you use the washing machine if it isnt constantly full of people queueing).\n\nLunch in my college(KMJ) is RM6-7 on average. So you could finish your entire gov allowance in about 10-11 days if your expenses are only for food.\n\n>UPU\n\nAs you may know, CS is Super Competitive in degree. It's 100% merit for Matriks/Asasi Category on most public unis. I'm unsure about diploma tho. You are taking a gamble on the UPU admissions system if you take matriks.\n\nAnd Matriks is just if you take it, you HAVE to go to degree, or else it's pretty useless.\n\nReply if you have any questions, I'd be happy to help with any questions relating to Matriks! :)", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750183742.0, "created_date": "2025-06-17T18:09:02+00:00", "author": "bobape", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1ldfvwn/b40_6a_spm_is_into_tech_stuffs_should_i_go_for/myb0fp7/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:03:58.207788+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1ldfvwn"}

If you dont believe me, try it yourself and read this again once you finished ASPER hahahaha, but all in all, just pick ASPER instead because 1. you already eligible to study in UPM for your degree later on (but still make sure to take care of your pointer) and UPM will prioritize their asasi student first 2. dont have to compete so much with other stpm/matrics/other foundations student (the credit to enter the degree program is much lesser as to compare to those apply in UPU, since its highly competitive, and especially those that are choosing a competitive programs - vet/sc comp/medic/engineering)\n\nhope that answer your questions ✌🏻", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750153123.0, "created_date": "2025-06-17T09:38:43+00:00", "author": "WelcomeLegitimate413", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1ldfg1v/dilemma_between_matriks_and_asper/my8hcz8/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:03:59.285132+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1ldfg1v"}

Need advice — Diploma in mechanical engineering or 2-year matrikulasi sains?", "content": "Hello there everyone, I am stressing and could really use some advice right now.\n\nI'm currently deciding between these two paths:\n\nDiploma in Mechanical Engineering or\n\n2-year Matrikulasi Sains\n\n\nI’ve always been interested in science and technology, so naturally, I’ve been considering both engineering and medicine. But right now, I’m really torn between the two and I’m honestly not sure which direction is right one for me.\n\nI didn’t meet the minimum requirement for 1-year matriks sains because I got an E in addmaths (barely lulus), which instantly made me not qualified to apply for any asasi relating engineering or sains (except for asasi perubatan unisza, but my parents didnt even allow me to put it in my upu choices because they thought its a \"bad\" uni). My other SPM results are pretty good imo: A- in Chemistry, Physics, and Bio, A in Maths, A+ in English, A in Malay, A in Pendidikan Islam, and B+ in Sejarah.\n\nBecause of that one bad result, I can only go for 2 year matriculation, which I have mixed feelings about cause it feels like an extra year \"wasted\". But if it helps me reach my goal of becoming a doctor, I’m willing to take it and do my best. The problem is, I’m still not sure if I want medicine over engineering. I know all about the current issues doctors are facing in Malaysia, the long hours, contract problems, job insecurity, etc. That has made me hesitate a lot, but even after knowing all that, I still can't silence the voice in my head telling me to pursue medicine.\n\nOn the other hand, going into diploma in mechanical engineering means I’ll immediately start learning something technical and engineering related, which my parents strongly prefer. They feel that it makes much more sense than going for a general science stream again in matriks. If I go this route, I’d most likely continue with a degree in mechanical engineering. But of course, I might regret not taking medicine for the rest of my career.\n\nSo I’m really stuck, should I go for something direct like a diploma in engineering, or take the more uncertain path through matriks in hopes of becoming a doctor?\n\nIf anyone here has been in a similar situation, or has experience with either diploma or 2 year matriks, I’d really appreciate your opinions. How did you make your final decision? Do you regret it? What would you do in my position?\n\nThank you in advance!

And need to be reminded that ASPUTRA is asasi tertutup means you only can further your degree in UPM and you are unable to apply at other public uni (unless you want to go to private). My advice, decide on what you want to do in your degree and explore degree courses and their requirement that UPM offers.

So now I'm sort of stuck between my two options because while I do like it here at USM and I planned to stay, if I go to UPSI, most of my uni expenses will be covered and I won't have to constantly worry about my family's expenses for me.\n\nI don't mind studying either, but I'm just a bit torn on what to do here. One will give me more options to pursue my dreams in the future and another will offer me job security. Which would be better?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1750071995.0, "created_date": "2025-06-16T11:06:35+00:00", "author": "Different_Panda_467", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lcpyjl/unsure_whether_to_continue_stpm_usm_or_go_for_upu/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:04:35.148455+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

{"id": "my1ojbf", "title": "Comment on: tips/advice for someone who's about to enter pasum...", "content": "Hey man congrats on getting into PASUM! Definitely a feat to be accepted here, I just finished my studies here but I was in the social sciences course so I may not be able to fully provide tips that would be relevant to you, but I hope it'll help eitherway\n\n1. Attend every lecture and focus, along with that do your tutorials. Just by doing this will be more than enough for you to be able to score well in exams. It's more about how consistent you are with the studying, as long as you don't neglect these two for the most part, you'll be fine\n\n2. PLEASE join as much college activities as you can, even if it's as simple as an audience. You'll be needing to obtain a minimum of 30 merit points for your UPU during degree intake for kokurikulum marks. I didn't participated much during semester 1 because I was chose to stay in my room to study most of the time and ended up having to grind and participate in various programs during the middle of semester 2 just to reach the minimum merit. Eitherway, joining these programs will help you gain experience on what it's like to work with others, so it's definitely a great learning experience.\n\n3. Be friendly with everyone. Everyone at PASUM were very friendly and while you may not be close with them compared to let's say your highschool friends, you should try to be friendly and let people be aware of who you are. Don't make the mistake of being overly quiet in class because you'll end up not being able to rely on anyone during times such as needing a favour or information\n\n4. Be on good terms with your roommates. This will make the experience at PASUM much more bearable. Communicate with them and share experiences. The connection is something that you'll cherish in the future. I was lucky enough to get such great roommates and I'm happy to say I'm proud to be roommates with them. Also, get alone with people from the other rooms too within the cube, my tip is to leave the door open so that it makes your room approachable.\n\n5. Be friendly with your tutors and lecturers. Trust me, they really want you to succeed, don't be afraid to ask questions and even have small talk with them. Having your name known to them will help immensely during times when you need help.\n\nThat's the broad sense of what I'd say you should do. I won't sugarcoat it but PASUM is indeed pretty tough so be prepared for that, make sure you have a good support system and good coping mechanisms to help; exercise, prayer, meditation, talking with friends. I wish you luck at your journey at PASUM, feel free to ask me any questions!", "score": 7, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1750061350.0, "created_date": "2025-06-16T08:09:10+00:00", "author": "Acceptable_Sundae864", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lcmt1m/tipsadvice_for_someone_whos_about_to_enter_pasum/my1ojbf/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:04:47.852792+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lcmt1m"}

{"id": "1lc0d5y", "title": "The tale of my horrible group experience", "content": "To provide you some context, my lecturer was anything but punctual. Always comes late, gives confusing instructions and really hard to consult with due to how busy the lecturer is. Next, we had to create a group of 4 to 5 members to work on a research report and article review. I had a group of 5 including me that was supposed to work on them in the span of the entire semester. You can guess what happened, yeah we did it last minute but that wasn't the worst part.\n\nBefore the last minute work even happened, I had to take initiative and be the leader (like every person who tries to do something in a group ever). Two of my group members were a couple and only seen together. I'll name the couple \"Mia and Naz\". The other two were unfortunately inept at the work but at least nice to talk to despite their incompetence. I'll call them Ali and Mohamad At first, the couple contributed to the work and helped out. Until 2 months went by and no update was told about the work. I had to press on the situation and asked everyone to update on the work using an online link so we can work on it together.\n\nWhen the first presentation for the review happened, my group was panicking because our work didn't follow the instructions of the assessment brief, so we had to improvise before other groups finished. I attempted to provide the link and asked them to edit it fast before our turn came. In the end, the couple decided to send a separate file where the rest of our group was unable to give any contribution to the presentation.\n\nFast forward a week later, when we had to send the research report, Mia and Naz then went silent and refused to write anything on the report. Even when I asked them to write something, they didn't budge even when I had to send the actual report. Only Ali and Mohamad attempted to help out with the project even though they were incompetent at it. Next, we had to prepare for the presentation after sending the report. Guess what? The couple still refused to update anything on the report and the only two remaining stuck with me.\n\nWhen the time for the next presentation came, Mia and Naz decided that they had to insult me for not doing a good job as a leader and said they had to do the work in the span of 30 minutes. As a leader, I have to admit that I made some mistakes with not reading the instructions properly, but the sudden insults thrown at me were really hurtful. In the end, we didn't present that day and decided to postpone the next day.\n\nI was really hurt when they said it to me. Because I knew part of that happened because of my mistakes as the group's leader, but at the same time, I was hoping if they could've talk to me sooner rather than saying it now.\n\nWhat should I do?", "score": 10, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1749994195.0, "created_date": "2025-06-15T13:29:55+00:00", "author": "ZeroMajor21", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lc0d5y/the_tale_of_my_horrible_group_experience/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:11.404829+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

{"id": "1l9uq79", "title": "I feel lost and useless...", "content": "If you are willing to spend time reading this rant, thanks in advance. \n\nSo I am a SPM 2024 leaver with considerable good grades, but I feel empty and miserable. Since kindergarten, I studied hard to please my family. The expectation of getting into university is drilled into my siblings' and my heads since we were young. I will give it my all for my studies even though I was burining out mentally and socially. For example, I will ghost my friends' messages and not hang out on weekends. During recess, I will study at the library while my friends are playing. The UPSR exam was my sole focus for my Standard 6 life. I stopped having fun, even with my siblings. I was afraid of disappointing my parents with bad grades. But I guess my parents have a role in my behaviour. My older brother doesn't take his studies seriously so my parents were strict with me as they didn't want me to be like him. They deleted my games and social media since Standard 4. My facebook account was only for family posts. They kept away my toys and had strict gadget usage. My only entertainment was Youtube or TV, which they restricted channels as well. \n\nMy social life was a wreck as I was banned from going out with my friends. I wasn't allowed to hang out with friends as my parents deem it useless so soon my friends stopped inviting me. I don't blame them. My personality was terrible. Looking back, even I will hate to hang out with someone so boring and miserable. Still, I still feel useful at school as the teachers loved a serious nerd and classmates liked me for my homework.\n\nAt last, I was number 1 at school with my UPSR forecast results with 8As. I thought everything would go well with my actual UPSR but fate played a cruel joke. I got 7As & 1B, with B being my usual best subject, English Writing. I was devastated as I worried about my chances of getting into elite schools like Sekolah Menengah SBS & SBU or even independent schools like Tsun Jin High. But that wasn't all the bad news. My parents apparently planned to send me to a backup government school (the type of school where they accept everyone, even those that failed UPSR as long as you did kelas peralihan). Their reason was it's cheaper and closer to our house. I was angry as I felt my grades and hard work were wasted there (the school was ranked the lowest for the district at one point). I was at my lowest. I couldn't enjoy anything even when my UPSR ended. I became miserable and pathethic. I was finally allowed to play games and toys but It felt joyless. My future is bleak as my hard work when down the drain. Those few months were really my lowest. But, I'm glad I didn't force my parents to spend money for private school. As I got older I understood their financial decision. \n\nAnother hard thing to swallow is that my primary and secondary school classmates mocked me for being a try-hard. I felt like I have fallen from grace. Most of my secondary school mates here just want to get a SPM cert. The environment wasn't motivating for someone who wanted to excel. Even my classmates joined school gangs gave up on their studies. I was on the brink of collapse due to peer pressure. Why not be like them and have fun?\n\nThen I met my Alex. I actually know Alex since primary school as they were a co-curricular high achiever. Although they failed to get into a top school, Alex never gave up and stayed positive. If it wasn't for Alex, I would have gave up my life and studies. Alex encouraged me to join competitions and prefects to try new things. My personality became more cheerful and positive, as well as my social life being more vibrant. I mixed with other students much better than before. My family relationships got better as I wasn't the annoying gloomy sibling anymore. I have the courage to have an open talk with my parents about how their actions impacted my school life. My first Facebook and Instagram friend was Alex. I had fun just chatting with Alex throughout MCO. They introduced me to their friends and my social circle expanded. I became quite popular at school as a hardworking student + prefect was pretty my gold for my school. I won competitions and tried out stuff I will never do without Alex's encouragement like volleyball and public speaking. It was going well until Form 3. MCO finally ended for real and our teachers were busy helping us catch up for PT3. I was doing well as my grades were quite consistent but Alex's wasn't. So I tutored them pretty much everyday at school and over WhatsApp. There was sparks ✨ and we were more than friends. I thought my life was turning around with maybe a chance at romance and a successful school life. Then PT3 was cancelled. A lot of my friends including Alex just let go of their grades. I was worried for Alex as I don't want to watch them mess up their future. Although there were bumps in our relationship, we were still close as we revise together.\n\nWhen our results were announced, Alex's results weren't as good as our expectations. Even though they were qualified for the 1st Science Class (Bio, Physics, Chem, Addmath), they chose the 2nd Science class (Accounting instead of Bio as it was so-called easier easier).\n\nAlex told me they weren't confident to take the pure science subject combination. Even though we were different classes, I tried to revise with them every day. They said they wanted to score their SPM so I gave my best to help. Sadly, time corrode everything. They started distancing themselves after making new classmates. We grew apart as Alex only wanted to pass and have fun. Their grades dropped until the teachers asked me to helped them. I felt powerless as I watched my friend gave up their future. The same person that helped me during my darkest time and now I couldn't do so. Alex and I promised to get straight As in SPM together. It's hard to find someone with a drive to excel in my school and I lost the only one I knew. My life felt incomplete. But what can I do as life goes on. I made new friends and build a new social life without Alex. We stopped talking for the entire Form 5.\n\nOn SPM results announcement day, I cried in my heart twice. First, Alex scored poorly in SPM. The school placed high hopes on Alex, the top co-curricular achiever and a good SPM result pretty much guarantees a nice scholarship spot. They blew their chance.\n\nThe second time I cried, it was my results. I got 9A+ & 1A- in Chinese. Chinese was a subject I struggled with since primary school. I consume English content mainly so I tried hard to improve my Chinese grades but SPM denies it. My trial results were 7A+ and 3A, so my chinese grade actually dropped from A to A-. But nooo, it isn't over yet. As the top scorer at my school , I was paraded around the school by teachers and students. Do you know the hurtful feeling as they praise you, then follow up with \"How can a chinese not score chinese?\" . Their cynical tone speaks clear. My legacy will forever be the senior that scored 9A+ and 1A- and people will remember my near-miss. \n\nI felt like I was on a constant losing streak. After SPM, I felt lost as my entire school life was driven by one goal, to excel in SPM with straight A+. I have no social life with my friends, I sucked at sports, I'm bad at having fun and I'm boring at parties. I have no hobbies as my parents thought it will distract me. I only remembered doom scrolling right after my last paper ended. That's how my youth ended. The boring nerd with no interest in life outside of school.\n\nAt one point, my school mental health test score was so bad that the counselling room was a place I visited frequently. My parents were even asked to talk in school. But, they just brush it off. They taught it was just common SPM stress. At one point, the counsellor considered getting a government psychologist appointment, but I thought the problems would fade with time and I didn't want to disturb my SPM exam. \n\nNothing improved. I thought being busy would help my problem. I looked for a full time promoter job after SPM to distract myself. After a month, my manager said that they no longer need a promoter as the Hari Raya sales ended and I got fired. Luckily, my tuition teacher gave me a part-time teaching gig so I didn't feel useless for not earning money. \n\nMy scholarship applications didn't bring any good news. I was qualified for all of them but I was rejected by all of them as well. Only PESP placed me on a waitlist. Then, I had my JPA interview a few days ago and my performance wasn't shining. Scholarship interview preparations were the only thing keeping me going after my SPM results disappointment. The Matrikulasi 10As policy announcement didn't help as I was rejected.\n\nTo sum it up, I felt terrible as nothing was going well for me. Look, I know the lesson of life is full of disappointments and we need to accept rejections with a open heart. But maybe it is because I was obsessed with SPM grades until I have nothing in my life, that hit me the hardest. I could have chosen a future with Alex where our grades weren't excellent, but we had teenage fun and craziness. I felt like I repeated my primary school life curse again at secondary school. A near miss result, not getting good news for further education and a failed social life. And before anyone tell me to go for STPM to fight for undergraduate scholarships, I can't because I missed the Form 6 registration date for a scholarship interview. There is no second chance for me. I don't want to burn through my parents' money just to fund my education. My father works in an SME and is nearing retirement age. I don't want to use up his epf because I was dumb to choose a scholarship interview over Form 6. It is even worse when I see people sharing how they don't care about getting a Matrikulasi seat while someone like me will beg for it. Then there are the privileged people where they score terribly, yet they have family money to get into private foundation studies. Those snobbish elite and private school students bragging how SPM was easy for them wasn't helping as well. You are telling me all my hard work for SPM is just something easy for someone else??? I felt like I achieved nothing and wasted my school life while my friends just continue to live on as if grades aren't important. They say they will just come out to work since they don't don't have clear education goals in mind.\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening to my vent. I hope everyone is fairing better than me.\n\n(Edit because of grammar mistakes and to make my story less confusing, I typed this out when I was crying last night so it is messy)\n\n  \n\n\n", "score": 172, "num_comments": 69, "created_utc": 1749754666.0, "created_date": "2025-06-12T18:57:46+00:00", "author": "Sharp_Television7087", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1l9uq79/i_feel_lost_and_useless/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:21.734698+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

I read your rant and i wish you the best in your life.\n\nI'm no more experienced than you nor have i faced what you faced in your life. I can't tell you what to do after this, nor how to further your study and so on. But, I'm very sure that you've learnt your lesson that you shouldn't be too fixated on a goal. It's important for us to balance our life between chasing goals (working, studying) and taking care of ourselves (having a hobby, socialising). it's called MODERATION. I know it may be hard with all the expectations they've put on you but know this. YOUR WELLBEING MATTERS, YOU MATTERS. Maybe not to the people around you, but you have To LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF AND LEARN TO HAVE FUN BY YOURSELF.\n\nFriends, especially ones like Alex rarely ever come by. You think that you understand them,know them. But in the end they are their own person, you can't control them or own them. If they're gonna leave. Let them. FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CARES FOR YOU. I know it's hard seeing Alex becoming like that but you've given your all.\n\nPlease DO NOT DWELL IN THE PAST anymore after this, most of the time you'll just hurt yourself and it rarely ever brings any good. I don't know how it feels to have such a big goal and such massive expectations be put on you. So much so that people could complain about one subject that you score less instead of focusing on the rest of 9A+. But, know this, MOST PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE ARE FLEETING, THEY COME AND GO , SOMETIMES THEY STAY LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE AN IMPACT, MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE THERE TO PULL YOU DOWN AND THEN THEY'RE GONE. Those teachers and people who make those mean comments , where are they now? Are they here to help you today? No right? Then they don't matter. No need to give so much care to the people who won't be in your life after a few years.\n\nFinally, START SEEING THINGS IN ALL IT'S PERSPECTIVE. 1A-? You got 9A+. 1B? you got 7As. Lose Alex? You've had a good run with them and they make you who you are today. I know that you target for more it's just human but HAPPINESS DOESN'T COME IN OWNING EVERYTHING YOU LOVE, BUT IN LOVING EVERYTHING YOU OWN.\n\nFinally, i want you to FIND YOUR VISION. Not goals, not targets, VISION. What do you want? Be rich and famous? Be a good person for society and your family? Create opportunities for other students like yourself? THE PATH AHEAD IS NOT CLEAR, BUT AS LONG AS YOU SLOWLY MAKES YOUR WAY TOWARDS YOUR VISION. YOU WON'T LOST YOUR WAY. and if you have to hurt your parents wallet a bit do it, if i had a child half as smart as you, I'll pay for their studies especially if they want it.\n\nOP, if you finish reading this, i wish you the best in your life. I hope I'm not harsh on you,if i did, it's not my intention. If you need someone to talk to, you can DM me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utc88o0j7k6f1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f89bacc6b82ad623eee5189cae8daa258bcd669", "score": 57, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1749760496.0, "created_date": "2025-06-12T20:34:56+00:00", "author": "Beat_da_Box_09", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1l9uq79/i_feel_lost_and_useless/mxg2nyb/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:22.739242+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l9uq79"}

I'm glad that you're able to get it out of your mind instead of bottling it all up and shoving it behind your mind. I must say your achievements are immensely admirably to me though I'm also from the same batch at you. I do empathise with you. \n\nReading your post somewhat feels familiar as I had that similar lifestyle. I'd like to think of myself as an overachiever with dreams of getting straight A+ for the sake of lessening my parents burden of paying for my tuition fees just to end up with a near miss destroying pretty much everything I had hoped for. No JPA, IPTA scholarships which barely cover the entire foundation fees. Had me in shamble for weeks on end seeing friends, classmates and desk mates attending interviews for scholarships. \n\nNot to mention, I kept getting ridiculed for having a near miss which all I could do was smile and laugh at when I was asked about. Though I may not have the grades like your nor the am in the place to give out advice, I'm pretty sure with your determination and will to try out new things, you'll be able to do well.\n\nAs for Alex, I'd always thought I had my Alex when I was inevitably just their backup friend so I resorted to doing most/ everything alone including studies and also co curricular activities alone. I'm usually more introverted and reserved therefore not being able to make friends that well but still I must say you should give it a try, talk and mingling with others despite their age as I've found some really close friends. A step at a time. \n\nAll in all, I wish you all the best in your future endeavours and if you need a friend, hit me up. I'd be glad enough to have someone to talk to.

I don't have much advice but I hope I can give you encouraging words because we're from the same batch. You did well for your SPM. Not even just well but AMAZING.

I'm not gonna tell you to be optimistic or give you advice, just sharing my support. I used to live with many regrets, things I could've done differently but I'm lucky enough to live a life with the least regrets for now. Also, I won't compare my life with yours because we live completely different lives but I'm glad you're holding on, OP.\n\nI know my words might be some stuff you've been told before, I can't offer advice but as someone your age and especially after reading your post, I just wanted to let you know I'm praying for life to work out in your favour.

I know this won't help but please know that there are others like you. Like me. Right here.\n\nI wouldn't say my social life is as bad as yours, and I'm not gonna paint myself as someone with a terrible life just to make you feel better. Instead, I'm just here to say that I see myself as lowly as you do. \n\nAcademically, I too scored 7As and 1B in UPSR. (I'm from SPM 2024 batch too). The B I scored was Chinese Writing, which was always my weakest subject. I was bothered by it, but not too badly as my path was to always study at a SMK secondary school, and I was never on course to continue learning Bahasa Cina. \n\nThen came secondary school. It was by no means terrible, but the first 3 years were basically half-existent as it was MCO impacted. I had less than 5 friends. I spent my days studying alone and drowned myself in my hobby of watching motorsport and pop culture. Things however, did change in Form 4 and Form 5. I made new friends. Aced my studies in school. Got slightly more sociable, and by the time SPM came around I had plenty of friends who enjoyed studying with me. \n\nI eventually scored 8A+ and 1A, which is satisfying until I messed up my university applications. Not only did I not get matrikulasi a month ago, but I wrongly filled up my UPU form, denying me any public universities and I missed quite a few scholarship application deadlines as I was still unclear about my future path. \n\nAside from academics, the past year hasn't been that great. My inner self was destroying me. Everyday even until today, I grow to be more hateful of my past actions and regrets (I won't dive deeper into it) but basically my issue of overthinking, low self-esteem and self doubt grows day by day. Hence, I've also been dealing with the problem of feeling like a burden to my parents especially now that I might have to study at a private university. Thankfully I do have a couple of friends who are always by my side.\n\nSorry if this hasn't been much of a help. What I'm trying to say is, life's not meant to be smooth sailing, especially for those in our phase. So pat yourself on the back. You've done great so far. \n\nTake a personality test, find out what you like to study, and go for it. Don't pressure yourself about the studying expenses because for once, you need to let yourself go. Stay optimistic, find the people who are right for you, and learn to be kinder to yourself. There are so many of us and I hope we can help each other through these empty days (or nights).\n\nHugs.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1749797322.0, "created_date": "2025-06-13T06:48:42+00:00", "author": "TraaLaarhLa", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1l9uq79/i_feel_lost_and_useless/mxisi4l/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:22.756375+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l9uq79"}
{"id": "mxipekj", "title": "Comment on: I feel lost and useless......", "content": "Hi OP, what you wrote resonated with me as it reminded me of my younger self, now I'm in my late 20s. What I'm about to tell you may hopefully change your perspective, depending on whether you choose to climb out of this darkness.\n\nWe have similarities in our school and friendship experiences. Like you, my parents were strict and nagged me constantly about my academic performance. I performed well until I reached sec school, where I had a falling out with my friends and struggled to focus on my grades. When it was time for SPM, I got straight As but couldn't secure a scholarship. I enrolled into Form 6 and sunk into depression, thinking how I am so useless. I did not do very well in the first two semesters, but when the third semester came, I decided to double down and grind. I told myself, \"You can just wallow in self-pity, or push yourself now. This is your last chance before entering uni. If you want to go to a better uni, you need to get your shit together.\" I ended up scoring an excellent but not perfect CGPA, and entered the uni and course of my choice on a scholarship by the grace of God. \n\nOP, what I am trying to say is that life can change, nothing that you are experiencing now is permanent. Yes, it sucks that so many things seem to be going against the flow for you. You don't have to respond to rejections immediately with positivity. It's fine to mourn what could have been. However, understand that you are still young, and have the rest of your life ahead of you. Right now, you may think grades and scholarships are the most important things. I know, I've been there, in fact, many of us do. Here's the thing, this is just the beginning of your journey in encountering rejections in life, there will be many many more which you will have to deal with. Likewise with friendship, you can't control who stays in your life. There will be people who come and go, appreciate those who stay, and be thankful to those who came to teach you lesson(s). \n\nAs you grow older, and make more friends in uni or as a working adult, you will realise that most friendships are formed out of necessity/similar stage in life, there is a possiblity one may outgrow the other and leave. 10 years later you will see just how many were as close as they were back in school/uni. Don't see yourself as having a failed social life, in fact, it's about to get started once you reach uni!\n\nLastly, some practical advice about your next step. Ask the school if it's possible to register for Form 6. It's still June, it might not be too late yet to enrol yourself. Try another school that offers Form 6 if you faced rejection from one school. Don't give up. Don't compare yourself with those who are privileged. OP, you achieved 9A+, you are smart and you have many opportunities ahead for you, it's all about seeking out for them and not giving up. If you are not rich, keep applying for scholarships, there are so many out there. If your parents are able to afford a private uni, you don't have to see it as burning their money. You can still obtain scholarships while studying in uni, there are plenty of tuition fee waivers, or if you want, PTPTN loans. \n\nFocus on your next step and block out the noise of self-blaming and comparison. Seek for advice from teachers, they've seen many cases and they might know of some opportunities. Exhaust your resources. Life is not just about academics, but they can still give you a good headstart in life. You are there OP with 9A+, many would kill to have the number of A+ you have, I would back then. Keep going, believe in yourself that you can make your life better.

The AC and fans work perfectly, and the apartments are overall well-maintained. Security and the wardens are kind and helpful. If you face any issues, you can contact the warden and they’ll usually assist you quickly. The swimming pools are also clean, depending on the block you’re in.\n\n**Annoying but can shrug it off:**\n\n* All gyms haven't been operational for months now lol.\n* There are only about three washers and dryers for the whole building. People often leave their laundry in the machines for hours and don’t come back, causing long delays for others lol.\n* some women/men literally go out half-naked on their balconies and expect people to just ignore and not stare ( tbh can't fully blame em cuz some apartments don't even have curtains installed, you can literally see everything )\n\n**Very Annoying and difficult to ignore:**\n\nPeople litter outside their balconies a lot, they literally stuck a poster on the elevators warning people not do to that and included a hefty fine if you do ( 500 ringgit )\n\nyou’ll hear people randomly screaming, shouting, and being loud for no reason on their balconies. It’s chaotic and gets annoying real fast ( sometimes literally at 3-4 am )\n\nroom placement is pure luck. You might end up living with international students who are straight-up filthy, leave the place a mess, and can’t even communicate properly in English. Good luck with that bro.\n\n**Prepare my son/daughter... If you read this part and still plan on coming then damn, you're either here cuz it's cheap and you ain't got any other solution or you're an ultra level sigma nonchalant diddy master:**\n\nThe internet here is trash.\n\nAnd I am not talking about the speed... ( speed is actually decent + just get a cheap Ethernet cable if you're installing something above 50GB )\n\nI’m talking about the restrictions that the network admin imposes on you.\n\nThe university admin blocks almost everything.\n\n* No YouTube comments ( literally unavailable on full videos and yt shorts )\n* They block YouTube videos flagged as 18+ ( say goodbye to your favorite youtubers )\n* Some websites & platforms just won't load at all ( popular ones as well like twitter or some sport/political news websites )\n* I ain't even a Cybersec or comp sci student and it's so easy to tell that they're tracking & watching all your traffic lol.\n\nIf your solution is “just use a VPN,” it’s not that simple. Most browser/desktop free VPNs are shit, and the good ones either reduce your speed significantly or require you to pay a ton of money.\n\nCOG looks good on the surface, but there are serious downsides.

I'm nearly done with my first year and I keep having thoughts of dropping out and joining other unis. \n\n# The reason why\n\n  Honestly, it just sucks here. The wifi hilang kadang2 and or is just genuinely slow gila. The student life kalau boleh just tanam masuk kubur je. Clubs are just dead and no one wants to do things. The lecturers some are fine some others are a pain. Campus has nothing to do. The sports facility here are lacking (Maybe sbb tu dah tambah berat). Makanan kat sini is expensive and taste straight buns. The Ai cha and subway aint helping too much either. The campus is sooo EXPENSIVE AND SO CRAMPED. And my batch (Cybersecurity) have no drive to do anything other than just nak cert. Its so sad actually. But some of the foreigners here just come and ruin things. Like dont get me wrong I dont hate anyone coming here for an education but some of them are just terrible. They come here with no qualification and start disrespecting the teacher thinking its cool. Some guy couldnt even do 0+1 binary. Some come in class make so much noise and menyalak cam anjing for attendance. The ones I dislike the most is the ones that force their culture onto us. I get it, you miss your culture and people. but bro..... Janganlah nak pasang lagu kuat2 and menari kat tengah dataran while everyone is bz with class. And for some reason, they think being rude the teacher is cool like its the 2000s..... The schedule is terrible btw. TWO DAYS WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE CLASS. AND ONE OF THEM ENDS AT 6PM. \n\n# My efforts to change things\n\n* Tried to join clubs or communities (Got ghosted instead)\n* Pay close attention to teachers (The people at the back is so genuinely loud you cant even hear what the teacher is saying)\n* Making use of their sport facility (Often gets hogged and the tennis court their students promote takde line pon.... Like its just white field.)\n\n# Conclusion\n\n  I hope I don't come off as some sort of spoiled brat who don't put effort to try. I genuinely did. But when I compare to other uni like UM. I just get reminded of how terrible this place is. Study was never an issue for me. But when things keep turning down it gets harder to find a reason to pursue the degree here. Sadly, Now I slowly keep skipping class because the drive nak pergi class is depleting. I'm not that high-achiever student anymore. I just feel dumb. I feel left out. Seeing others have fun and always joining events hosted by clubs. I get sad even more. I enter this dumb place thinking it will get me my future cybersecurity job and yet here we are. It gets even worse when I see my friends going overseas to study with prestigious scholarships. I studied hard as well but never got that opportunity. okay sorry for the rant thank you for reading.", "score": 65, "num_comments": 36, "created_utc": 1749131820.0, "created_date": "2025-06-05T13:57:00+00:00", "author": "Low_Assist6061", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1l3zujy/i_think_ive_hit_rock_bottom_at_this_point_i_keep/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:28.342325+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

The feeling of loneliness is all good, and you don't need to urge yourself to meet new guys. I am glad you choose.tp study in uni. The feeling of loneliness is not a bad thing, because it captures the things that you truly want without other voices. Maybe, it's your time to feel  alone, and you should cherish this moment, and talk to your heart. I went through the feeling of loneliness before when I newly entered my uni life and wanted to meet new guys, but now I didn't feel that way because I don't require myself to meet more new guys but the guys that have same energy, topic and mindset with me, and I work in silence and focus my academy. You need to believe in yourself, because when you know what you do, and what you need in your uni life, you will not feel alone, because through the process you go through, you end up to meet some guys you like to get along with.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1749825182.0, "created_date": "2025-06-13T14:33:02+00:00", "author": "Upstairs-Roll-1683", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1laae5x/anyone_feeling_lonely_after_going_to_uni_or_is_it/mxkiftj/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:34.543633+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1laae5x"}

Had a dream of pursuing medicine with 5As in SPM Including Biology, Chemistry, Maths, English and one other subject. Went for foundation in science in IMU and finished in 2022 with CGPA of 3.06 (I did not reach the requirement for MBBS). Consulted my parents and was still confused about what to do since I was missing a B for physics and the required GPA for MBBS. Decided to go into Biomedical science degree at IMU. Did one semester of BioMed with a lot of lab work, did not find it inspiring whatsoever (felt like I was only there because I couldn’t get into medicine). During the end of my first semester exam of Biomed, my father was diagnosed with nose cancer. Felt extremely discouraged to continue and lost hope. I dropped out of my biomedical degree and my father gradually went through chemo and radiotherapy and was treated (for now). Fast forward a year later and I’ve decided to give medicine another shot, retook my foundation and SPM with the support of my parents and got the required grades (A in physics and 3.7 GPA in Foundation). Applied to medical school a month ago, went for an interview and got the spot. Now waiting for my intake to start in September. So my question would be, in your opinion, and there are no wrong answers, did I make the right decision in my journey? Or could I have done anything differently to have a better outcome?", "score": 30, "num_comments": 27, "created_utc": 1749912627.0, "created_date": "2025-06-14T14:50:27+00:00", "author": "Deep_Presentation270", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lbahlp/healthcare_degree_journey_so_far_asking_for/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:36.355684+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

When your father fell ill, it was not to break you, but to awaken in you a deeper understanding, the burden of uncertainty, the fear of loss, the fragile nature of life. These are truths no curriculum can teach. You mourned. You fell. You let go. And then you returned stronger, clearer, and aligned with purpose. That perseverance shaped by love and experience will always shine brighter than ambition born of pride. Those were the moments that built the version of you who’s ready for medicine *now*. You’re not stepping into this field with just a GPA. You’re stepping in with lived pain, empathy, humility and fire. That matters more than you know.\n\nSometimes the universe delays our dreams so we arrive as the person who can actually handle them. You were meant to pause. You were meant to feel lost. And you were meant to find your way back on your own terms. That’s what makes this real. So yes, you made the right decision. In fact, you’ve been making the right ones all along, even when it didn’t feel like it. You were never off the path. You *are* the path.\n\nAnd when the time comes, you’re going to be the doctor someone else desperately needs. Not just because you studied hard but because you lived through the kind of story that teaches you how to care. You’re ready now. And you didn’t get here by accident. You got here because it was always meant to be this way. You’re going to help so many people one day. You don’t see it yet, and when the time comes, you’ll understand why everything had to happen exactly the way it did. You will do a lot of good in this world, all the future good you will do, all the the people you will save in the future. Hope this advice give you strength.", "score": 22, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1749918641.0, "created_date": "2025-06-14T16:30:41+00:00", "author": "Prestigious-Fun441", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lbahlp/healthcare_degree_journey_so_far_asking_for/mxria69/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:36.938511+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lbahlp"}

I am from SG and I really wanted medicine since I was in primary sch and worked hard towards it. Got all As in A levels but didn’t get into NUS and NTU Med and spent my 2 years of NS thinking about all my options overseas medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, etc etc. I even tried to make myself feel like I want to go another course since going overseas medicine is very2 expensive and felt like a burden to my parents. End up I couldn’t and all i wanted was medicine and to become a doctor as I couldn’t find myself having a fulfilling career going to another course/job. \n\nMy friends told me this “would you rather spend 30k to go another course in NUS and dislike ur course n have a job you don’t enjoy for the next 20-30 years OR spend 400k studying medicine overseas and have a once in a lifetime experience and enjoy ur job for the next 20-30 years”\n\nI ended up picking the latter and spent my NS applying for med schs and thinking about options while also always thinking if this is really what I wanted. Coincidence much (also the reason im in malaysia reddit) I’m gonna go IMU this Sept too LOL HAHAHA.\n\nTherefore, I think you made the right option in your journey. After all, it’s what you want correct. You even went biomed and felt it didnt click with you. You already tried the other option. There’s also no point of thinking whether you couldve done anything differently. You already got ur A and increased ur GPA and got ur spot in medicine!

{"id": "1lad9nb", "title": "What to do after high school other than uni, or anyway I can still enter uni ?", "content": "I’m 17, Just Graduated, and Completely Mentally Exhausted from My Family. I Don’t Know What to Do Anymore.\n\nI’m 17 this year (turning 18 in October) and I just graduated from high school. I got 4B+, 1B, and 2C — not excellent, but good enough to enter college and qualify for many courses. I should feel proud and excited, but I’m honestly just exhausted, hopeless, and emotionally numb because of everything I’ve gone through with my family.\n\nFamily Struggles During Exams\n\nDuring my final exams, my life was a mess. I didn’t even have a proper place to study — no room, no peace. When I needed money for school-related things, I asked my mom. Instead of just saying no, she told me to “call your dad” (my divorced father). I hate having to beg him for money, and it gave me so much stress that it affected my studies badly. I asked her to stop putting me in the middle, but she didn’t listen. Eventually, I broke down and started breaking things around the house because I couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nThey sent me to my dad’s house, but it didn’t get better. I was still overwhelmed, I broke things again, and my dad physically abused me — he slapped and punched me. I ran away and called my mom to pick me up, but she said she was “too far away.” I felt totally abandoned by both parents.\n\nLater, I told my dad to stop giving me money at all — I’d rather be broke than deal with the mental stress. My mom then called to scold me, saying, “Your dad said you told him to stop giving money, and now he’s not giving me money either — how can I give you money?” She still kept asking me to text him for money even during my exams.\n\nConstant Disrespect and Emotional Pain\n\nThere’s also the emotional embarrassment she caused me. My school is about 80% Muslim students. On sports day last year, my mom wore short and tight clothes to the stadium. My teachers complained to me, and I was so ashamed. I begged her not to dress like that this year, but she argued, saying “it’s a stadium, not school.” She never once considered how I felt.\n\nShe always talks like she has money and can do whatever she wants. She uses money as a weapon against me — saying things like “if you think you can manage, then don’t ask me for money.” That sentence was the final blow that ended one of our biggest arguments. I just stayed silent after that.\n\nI Didn’t Even Show Her My Results\n\nWhen I got my results, I didn’t show her. I didn’t feel like she deserved to see them. I was happy with myself for what I achieved despite everything, but it also brought up all the pain. I kept thinking, “If not for her, I could’ve done even better, or at least I wouldn’t have had to suffer like this.”\n\nI sent her information about the college I wanted to go to — the fees are about RM30k. Back in high school, she told me her budget for college was RM40k. But now, suddenly, she said RM30k was too expensive. I felt so betrayed. Another lie.\n\nSo I gave up asking for her help and instead sent her a long message listing all the things she’s done to hurt me. She didn’t apologize — she just replied with explanations and excuses for everything, not taking any real accountability. That hurt even more.\n\nLater, I went to her condo (where she lives with her new husband) to confront her. She looked scared but still acted rude. I called her husband, and she got even more angry and texted me a bunch of things. After that, we stopped talking.\n\nMy Last Attempt at Help\n\nRecently, she texted me again saying, “Your aunty told me you want to go to that college.” I replied dryly, because honestly, I don’t need her help anymore. She’s dead in my heart. Then she sent something like:\n\n“If you don’t tell us anything, don’t come back later and blame us for you not going to college.”\n\nWhen I saw that message, I was furious. I replied:\n\n“How dare you say that when it’s your fault.”\n“I already planned everything and you both ruined it.”\n\nShe just replied with a “👍” emoji — which honestly felt like she was saying, “Whatever, don’t go to college then.”\n\nMy Dad is No Better\n\nDuring high school, my dad told me he had a RM20k budget for college. I asked him to help pay for a foundation course that cost RM24k. He said, “OK, I’ll find money and pay next week.” But after a week — nothing. Fine, I found another foundation course for RM6.5k, expecting him to pay that at least — still nothing.\n\nSo I changed my plan. I decided to go for a diploma instead, which costs RM33k for 3 years. I could apply for a government loan and repay about RM900/month after graduation. But my dad said:\n\n“I can’t borrow the loan. I didn’t pay my taxes. They’ll find out.”\n\nAt that point, I was speechless. Hopeless. I lost so many emotions. I don’t even feel excited or passionate anymore.\n\nConclusion: I’m Stuck and Tired\n\nI’m turning 18 this October. Most colleges already started in May or June, and only a few start in July. I can’t borrow a PTPTN loan yet because I’m still 17. My mom can pay, but I don’t want to beg her. My dad is useless.\n\nIf I don’t enter college this year, I’ll have to wait until next year. That means I’ll fall behind my peers, graduate later, and waste more time.\n\nI feel like I’ve tried everything and done my best. All I wanted was to study, move forward, and have a future. But my own parents are the reason I feel stuck and broken.", "score": 27, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1749813259.0, "created_date": "2025-06-13T11:14:19+00:00", "author": "igetusedtobebored", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lad9nb/what_to_do_after_high_school_other_than_uni_or/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:37.067641+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

For context, my brother studied computer science software engineering and he had taken about 1.5 years more than the traditional 3 years graudation period. He started in 2018 and graudated in 2023. So my question is, that is this the norm to graduate late because I would prefer not to extend my studies for that long. He told me the studies are really hard to cope, that led him to fail, and retake subjects the next year (?). \n\n\nSo im torn apart between trying to study Finance in Universiti Malaya, or to study in APU university (Asia Pacific University). \nFunnily enough my sister is an international student in Taylors University, and she insists that I go to UM because she said the grass isn't greener on the other side, theres \"hard work\" that we can't run away from in both private and public universities. But i am sure there has to be some differences right. For instance, I've heard its hard to get close to the lecturer and you've got to self study everything in UM, or depend on the internet rather than the university itself, while in private universities the lecturers try to help their students more. \n\nI don't know of all of this is hearsay, it would be appreciated for anyone to confirm that the studies in UM are actually so competitive that its not worth the pain? Or is it worth the pain? And how long does the average person take to graduate? if you are an alumni yourself or you know anyone who is, please let me know anything you are aware of about the reputation of private universities and if they are worth it or we go to public universities anyways if given the chance. \n\nAnyways, I've yet to apply to Universiti Malaya so I guess the debate may be of no use once i apply and see I haven't made the cut. Also I've heard that S.T.E.M fields are usually competitive by default and its a little laid back for finance students in Universiti Malaya (im planning to study finance). Can anyone confirm this?\n\nTLDR: Can anyone share their study experience in Universiti Malaya and explain what exactly made their experiences so hard and unique from other universities?

I even considered doing part-time work at cafes or restaurants, but I’ve been rejected there too. To make things more complicated, immigration has been raiding eateries, and most local and foreign businesses avoid hiring foreigners.\n\nSome companies have mentioned visa sponsorship, but that typically requires converting my student visa to a work permit — a process that’s long, expensive, and mostly handled by large international firms (which is never easy to get in). the process even involves leaving Malaysia and waiting abroad for months, which I simply can't afford.\n\nSo, I’m reaching out to fellow international students in Malaysia:  \n**Has anyone here managed to get a remote job (freelance or otherwise)?**  \nIf so, how did you find the opportunity, and how are you receiving payments safely and legally?\n\nAny advice, resources, or success stories would mean a lot.

My employer doesn’t mind. I had this job even before I moved to Malaysia but it’s an online, WFH job nonetheless. Many of my colleagues are from around the world.\n\nThey deposit my salary to my personal bank account back home (savings account), I have an international debit card issued by my bank for this account so I just withdraw the cash in Malaysia with it (an additional 3.5% is cut off every time I withdraw/use this card since it’s goes as an international transaction but it’s fine) once I withdraw the cash I deposit it into my Malaysian account and use it like normal since it’s easier. But you can just use your international debit card if you want to.\n\nTotally safe, legal and possible.\nNote; I don’t earn A LOT so I’m not sure about large amounts but it works for me. I earn about 500-600 MYR this way (including the 3.5% cut off) \n\n- Try selling your notes online or offer a service. \nLike if you’re good at writing or digital art you can offer those services for a price.

Spread the word to your friends and family and you ought to get someone to teach and it will slowly build up from there) this works because I do this too part time lol.\n\n- Most Malaysian Unis have work opportunities at their international / internal offices. International students are allowed to work here. Ask your uni if there’s an opening.\n\nSince you’re a masters student your skills may be be more valuable than someone younger or less qualified (qualification ≠ to skill though it truly depends on the organisations values) so try your luck online (especially back home) rather than at physical or WFH organisations in Malaysia.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1749981112.0, "created_date": "2025-06-15T09:51:52+00:00", "author": "SolutionBig4097", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1lb8u6p/international_student_in_malaysia_any_success/mxvvih8/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:48.153646+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lb8u6p"}

Afaik, they open the application three times per year but nowadays they opened it quite late in the middle of the year. It seems like nothing but if you're enrolling in the early year intake, it's going to hurt your wallet a lot trying to survive while waiting for the application. My uni rn is demanding these students to pay the tuition fees first, which costs like RM6k, and giving them only 6 months to pay. Not to mention about the new policy where you're not eligible to apply it at all if you used other financial aid like PTPTN before even if you could terminate the loan. So basically they have no choice to either find part-time jobs or just straight up quit.\n\nLet this be a precaution to those who seeks to pursue your studies. I'm aware that this issues are all over Malaysia but it's a common occurrence in IPMa institutes since their primary financial aid is from MARA. If you have better options (i.e. Public universities) with less tuition fees, then you better pick that one. If you still want to just because of MARA loan, I don't think it's a good time to continue your studies this year since they're still altering a lot of policies probably due to economic issues. \n\n", "score": 14, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1749476977.0, "created_date": "2025-06-09T13:49:37+00:00", "author": "Existential-Dread416", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1l75b1z/if_youre_going_to_any_ipma_universitycolleges_for/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:05:52.920444+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}

If you don't know, UNIMAS is quite a large place for students without a transportation, so have to spend 5-20 minutes walking around. I'm not Sarawakian, so I didn't plan to buy a vehicle, yet.\n\nSome context about my food insecurity, It's hard to keep track which stall/cafe opens in UNIMAS, as there are no apps or dedicated group to update the students. Sure, you can ask in college group if student pavilion/allamanda cafe/other places are open, but during holiday where most people have already went home, your chance of knowing is lowered. I have ordered grabfood for days and it's making my wallet kinda hurts (Almost RM60+ per day, less if I want to eat some instant mee). \n\nCan't really cook in college either, unless you do it secretly. I'm planning to move out of campus once this semester is over and get a motorcycle/car/a breathing, living horse (jk).\n\nSo any advices to save some money, or at least overcome the food insecurity for at least 2 months?

{"id": "1l2z6xi", "title": "I visited TOA, Clazroom and Dasein (for 2d illus)", "content": "I visited these 3 art schools when I went to KL (I'm from Sabah) to really hone in on my decision on where to go to study 2D ILLUSTRATION, and here are all the things I noticed when I was there. (Tours, counsellors, the general vibe, and pros vs cons)\n\nNote: ALL these schools say they invite industry professionals. Moreover, please don't take this as your final take on these schools; I highly recommend visiting these schools for yourself.\n\nDasein: \nThe best way to describe the lobby is that it's really cosy, the counsellors are nice, the library is a selling point with mangas and a bunch of stuff, their hallways are frustratingly not straight, and empty spaces are filled with students' final year projects. \n\n(I've heard some ppl saying Dasein is more Chinese-orientated, but I asked, and they said English is their main teaching language, this goes to the other 2 schools as well.)\n\nTHEIR TOILETS ARE THE BEST BY THE WAY. REALLY CLEAN.\n\nWhen we discussed some things with the counsellor, we brought up how different it is with TOA since I heard Dasein was titled \"A cheaper TOA\". Surprisingly,  Dasein compares itself to MIA instead. Accommodation seems cozy enough and it's really near to a convenience store and some restaurants.\n\n2d illustration course fees: RM55k+ \n\nPros:\n - really cozy\n- their classroom are actually spacious enough\n- provides a \"scholarship\" if you do well enough so you could cut down like a tiny amount of money lol\n- convenient school placement so groceries and lunch aren't really a problem\n- a good school if you don't wanna think too hard about which school to go lmao\n- they also have clubs\n- a recording booth beside the library\n\nCons: \n- Jack of all trades, Master of none. \n- Their 2d illustration is so weird; just traditional drawing takes up a year, while the other 2 take up 3 months; it may seem better to say, \"Oh, we gotta hone in your base skills\", but that just leaves only 1 year and 8months to learn everything else.\n- there seems to be some complications between student and staff relationship. \n\nConclusion: The first to visit, and the first to eliminate because of how weird their 2d illus course is.\n\nClazroom: (A TVET type school, which means spm results doesn't matter much) \nIt really has a tech feel with all the students and teacher's work on the walls. Their classrooms are smaller compared to the others and their auditorium door design is such a gigachad move😭😭 also they collaborated with PUBG, HOK and the Postknight team WHICH THEY PUT UP THE CHARACTER CUT OFFS IN THE HALLWAY MY GOAT😭😭😭\n\nAlso, small complaint but their building is so hard to find, (for us) because both of our grab drivers couldn't find the dang thing lmao\n\nClazroom has connections to Japan, and lucky enough you'll have a chance to go to Tokyo with them to study. The final semester is an internship programme too. \n\nTheir toilet is kinda mid\n\n2d illustration course fees: RM52k+\n\nPros: \n- more anime-orientated\n- This school is more hands-on since it's TVET based\n- Equipment provided on the first day (drawing tablet)\n- their school is pretty spacious too for only 3 floors\n- they have clubs as well\n- they have an art camp from July 18-20th (I'm going hehe) \n\nCons: \n- really cold lmao\n- the general vibe seems...dead. I think it's because we were on tour when they were learning but my dad pointed out that the students seemed uh. soulless. \n- no scholarships\n\nConclusion: my final pick because it most resonated with me and my style.\n\nTOA:  (THE FINAL BOSS.)\nFirst up. The art hung up in the lobby is insane. They have a whopping 25 floors all for them, too, BUT. \n\nI have noticed their hallways are really suffocating. It's really professional and you're pretty much reminded 24/7 what you're learning for. ALSO THEIR TOILETS ARE ASS. \n\nMy major gripe with the tour is the tour guide made us watch a small movie, which, I kid you not, is just them boasting about their awards. They mentioned their rookie awards TWICE, and I almost fell asleep. My dad spoke up, \"I'm sorry, but we're more interested about 2d illustration course...?\" and the tour guide was like \"pls watch this thing first\" I was like omg get it over with\n\nTheir accommodation is actually insane, THEY HAVE 3. 3 PROPERTIES. FOR YOU. AND THEY ARE ALL INSANE, LIKE BEAUTIFUL. \n\n2d illustration course (3 years): rm92k+ \n\nPros: \n- pretty much everything you want in an art school; they literally have everything, including motion capture too. \n- you could just feel the sheer quality of this school like it's actually insane.\n- accommodation is pretty asf\n\nCons: \n- The fees. I shouldn't have to elaborate.\n- As I said, the hallways are suffocating. It feels really competitive, and I wasn't comfortable for the whole duration there. (Art is competitive after all)\n- (for 2d illustration) Despite the fact the founders are illustrators, TOA seems to take pride in their 3d animation and Flim visual effects. \n- I noticed that they don't have clubs? \n- the only scholarship they have is like the competition they hold and if you're in the top 10. \n\nConclusion: TOA is massive. If I had to put Clazroom as ranked 2nd and TOA as ranked 1st, the gap is massive, bro, like it's not even close. It was never close, to begin with. \n\nFinal conclusion: TOA if you're money packed, clazroom if you're anime orientated, dasein if you don't wanna think too hard about it.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1749021082.0, "created_date": "2025-06-04T07:11:22+00:00", "author": "Unusual_Promise_8114", "subreddit": "malaysiauni", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1l2z6xi/i_visited_toa_clazroom_and_dasein_for_2d_illus/", "timestamp": "2025-06-25T18:06:04.115228+00:00", "fetch_method": "reddit_api", "content_type": "post"}
