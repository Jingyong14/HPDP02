n2b9tap,"Factual comments: 1. Prior to 2022, it would have been impossible to create this chart using [traditional DOSM population data.]( Because DOSM data is in 5y age groups (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, etc), and the oldest group is 85+; no visibility on Centenarians. 2. After the implementation of automatic voter registration, *every single citizen* who is still alive appears in SPR data. This enables us to get amazing insight into our population! 3. At the time of GE-15 in 2022, there were 25,445 living Centenarians in Malaysia. The only previous announcement I can find is from 2015, when Menteri KDN (Zahid at the time) announced that there were [43,599 aged 100+ still alive.]( If true, this is a HUGE drop over just 8 years. I'm guessing the pandemic had something to do with that. The chart above contains a detail that I find absolutely insane: * More men than women from ages 18 to 46 * More women than men from ages 47 to 99 * More men aged 100+ I have a few (speculative) theories for why this pattern emerges: 1. For the younger age groups, I'm guessing it's the effect of marriage between foreigners and locals, after which the foreigner gets citizenship. Since our foreign resident population is predominantly male, it makes sense that we see more men in the working age range. 2. At higher ages, the 'women live longer' effect becomes clear. This is a well-established finding globally for a number of reasons: Men have more dangerous lifestyles (both work and non-work related), men smoke more, drink more, are more obese, and so on. However, while the general conclusion that 'women live longer' is well-known, I was surprised that the stats are so solid - not a single age from 47 onwards has more living men than women! 3. We know there was hanky panky with our voter roll in the past (almost certainly not anymore), with giving of easy citizenship to foreigners. These foreigners would have mostly been male and young. However, the pattern I cannot explain is why the 'women live longer' trend reverses after age 100!",positive,positive,0.6983,positive,0.999

Assuming if a female is widowed at age 40+ back 50 years ago, the female would have 'lost' 15+ years worth of income that the husband may otherwise have been earning. Since there are more female from age 47-99, we can assume there are more widows than widower withount accounting for situations of multiple wives, and with the assumption that males tend to hold more dangerous work, it is a very likely that there are more widows than widower. \- As a continuation of the above points, some family may allocate a higher inheritence to their sons over their daughters due to family tradition, religious tradition and what not.

The sub is one of the biggest on Reddit and as a community it's so important - particularly for a topic like travel which is rooted in authentic human experiences - that all responses come in the form of genuine opinions and guidance. There's absolutely no point in us all being on here otherwise. Mods have tools to identify these sort of posts, but it's worth reiterating moving into 2025 and with increased AI available in our day-to-day lives that any usage of this sort to make your posts or comments will result in an instant ban. The rules are stated very clearly in the sidebar and are not new. None of us joined this community to read regurgitated information from a machine learning model like ChatGPT. AI tools can have their place for travellers sometimes, but outside of the occasional spellcheck or minor translation it should never be the main foundational element for any of your posts on this sub. We want responses to be *your* opinions and knowledge. If you're asking a question, we want it to be in *your* voice. If you suspect any usage we haven't spotted, report it - we are a group of volunteers on a huge sub and things often slip through the net.

1lw10po,"Hey guys, Looking for a bit of advice and any experience from travellers who have been in a similar scenario. I flew from Manchester to Austin 9 days ago with British Airways. I currently live in Austin and was back in Manchester for a wedding. When I arrived at Austin airport my baggage wasn‚Äôt there - no problem, the BA assistant asked me to fill out a form with a pen and paper and she informed me that the luggage would be sent out the next day. I did offer to come back to the airport to collect but they said they‚Äôd handle it. The following day I had a missed call from a random number whilst I was working. I immediately called back and the call went straight to voicemail. I then received a text saying they have attempted to deliver my luggage unsuccessfully. This was a third party company called ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my suitcase‚Äù - ironically named considering that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve wanted to know for the last week! After numerous back and forth with BA and this mysterious company who are pretty much uncontactable, BA informed me that WMS had left a note on my file saying that I answered the phone call on the day of delivery and ‚Äútold them to f*** off‚Äù - something I would never say to anyone unnecessarily, but even more so if they are the bridge between me and my belongings. I asked for proof of this phone call to which BA couldn‚Äôt give me, but concluded that when I wrote down my number at Austin airport the assistant who helped me must have added my number into the system incorrectly - however I have since realised that this can‚Äôt be true because WMS did try to call me when they were delivering the bag. I believe this is probably some sort of tactic for the delivery driver to not have to wait around for too long and return those item back to WMS‚Äô warehouse or return the suitcase back to the airport for BA to deal with. For the past week I‚Äôve been trying to find my luggage - and eventually spoke to someone at BA a few days ago who said that my suitcase was at the warehouse with their third party courier (WMS) and they will inform them to return it to the airport. This morning I spoke with BA who confirmed my baggage was at the airport. I left work, spent $25 to head from Downtown Austin to the airport at around 12:30 and spent the next 3 hours at the airport trying to find my luggage. Every staff member at BA I spoke to brought up the fact that there was a note on my file saying I had been rude to the delivery driver (genuinely driving me insane because it didn‚Äôt happen!!!) and none of them could locate my bag. They then decided they would pay me out for my lost belongings - and handed me a post it note to write down my name, number, and the value of the items inside the suitcase. I left the airport and booked a taxi - no longer than 5 minutes later the woman I had last spoke to rang me and said she had found the suitcase! I went back to the desk and was really really grateful that this lady had gone out of her way to find it. She said the suitcase had been left in a closet in the BA office at the airport as they didn‚Äôt really know what to do with it considering the note they had received from the delivery driver was that the person they had tried to contact (me) had told them not only to ‚Äúf*** off‚Äù - but also ‚Äúnot to ring this number again‚Äù. (Genuinely laughable that any person rotating 2 pairs of underpants until they have their suitcase back would say this) I returned to work and then about an hour ago got back to my apartment to finally unpack, to discover that 50% of the items in my suitcase are missing. Someone has been through it and picked out the more expensive items. I treat myself to nice clothes when I can afford to - they‚Äôve taken shirts, t shirts, trainers, shorts, trousers, a bottle of aftershave I hadn‚Äôt even opened yet. I have just rang the lady at BA who rang me when she found my suitcase - and she said this has never happened before and she will ‚Äúinvestigate further‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything she can do. Am I just in a scenario of their word against mine? I don‚Äôt want to be a Karen but the fact that someone has gone through my luggage is really not sitting right with me. Is this a police matter? I can prove that I purchased most of the items that are missing but some of which were gifted to me. The delivery company seem very sketchy, and I already know they lied about what I said to them on the phone - I 100% never spoke to anyone at that company. The lady at BA said where the bag was left would have been secure and there is CCTV that she is going to look through, she admitted the only time the bag was not under surveillance was when the delivery driver was in possession of it.

We both live on the East Coast of the United States we are open to this being a 2 to 3 country or city visit. Though we do want to be realistic, as we have definitely overstuffed some of our prior travel itineraries elsewhere. We hope to be flying out of Paris at the end of the trip, but are trying to identify a good city to fly into. We were thinking depending on flights, flying into Amsterdam and taking the train from Amsterdam through Belgium to Paris to finish out with a few days in Paris. This will be the third week in November, so hopefully the start of Christmas market season, which would be great to hit some special ones. I have not been to Western Europe in the past decade or so would love if anyone has some pointers or ideas - looking for cool walkable cities/towns, history, art, food. I speak Spanish and some French. We are both metalheads and enjoy finding locals shows as well, but that doesn't need to be a deciding factor.

You need to check whether the huts are open in the time you want to travel and some of them you have to prebook at least 6 months in advance. That said, you don't have to hike the whole thing at once. You could base yourself either in Chamonix or in Courmayeur and do day hikes from there. You could hike half of the TMB that way, for example. Given those two choices, I would recommend Courmayeur. In those towns, no hut prebooking is necessary, one can just stay in the hotels and take public busses to the hiking starting points. You could also stay 3 days in Courmayeur and 3 days in Chamonix. The Interlaken area in Switzerland (Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald etc) is one of the most beautiful places I have seen nature wise. I am also an avid hiker and would recommend either Switzerland or the Mont Blanc area. The most amazing hike I have ever done was the Laugavegur hike in Iceland, but it has a very narrow window when you can do it. Not spring / autumn but only summer I believe, too dangerous otherwise. K√∂nigssee in Bavaria, Germany is also really beautiful, but maybe more of an extended weekend trip thing and not for a full week.",positive,positive,0.9794,positive,0.9989

While it doesn't have as many high-profile tourist attractions as, say, Sydney, I truly loved Melbourne's feel and vibe. It's an arts and cafe culture kind of city, full of festivals, events, low-key neighbourhood spots, and a vibrant and diverse food, drinks, and music scene. One unique thing I remember about Melbourne's nightlife were the semi-hidden lane bars. I'm sure these days the info is all over social media, but back when I visited in the pre-smartphone days, you kinda had to discover them via word of mouth. Hidden tucked away in alleyways and nondescript underground locations, many of the lane bars had different specialties, and if you found one and made friends with the bar staff, they'd often point you to two or three others, leading to a really great scavenger hunt-type pub crawl.",positive,positive,0.9947,positive,0.9995

Note that the cafes in both branches are truly terrible though. * Going to the South Melbourne Market * Visiting Williamstown - this is the former seaport for Melbourne and is really characterful * Going to concerts Some things that I consider over-rated are: * Queen Victoria Market - too many of the stalls are selling cheap tat.

I love my country, but carrying a weak passport is just‚Ä¶ not it. It gets worse because I'm a freelancer. No long-term labor contract = extra suspicious. So I have to dig up contracts from my clients, I work with fintech companies in the US like Hood, SoFi, WTF, etc. I have to screenshot the signed contracts with their names on it, get these companies to verify my identity, show bank statements matching the payments, highlight every detail so the embassy doesn't think I'm faking it? And sometimes if I'm traveling with my partner or anyone else in my family or my friends? More paperwork: photos together, proof of relationship, all that. And more savings. Because apparently if you don't have $10k+ sitting around, they won't believe you're coming back home. Meanwhile, after all that work and money spent, there's still a chance they'll just say no. No refund. Just a rejection stamp. I know why it's like this, there are so many people from poorer countries like mine who overstay or try to live illegally in richer countries. It happens all the time, so we get blacklisted. But it's depressing when you realize there's basically zero hope that your passport ranking will ever improve.

Dubrovnik (1 night) - I know it's supposed to be very touristy and pretty expensive, so I just want to go for 1 night to get a taste of it 5. Mostar (2 nights) 6. Sarajevo (5 nights) Let me know if you have any advice! The things I'm worried about are: 1. Am I doing too much? On previous solo trips I stayed in each place a bit longer, but I feel like a lot of the destinations here are pretty small. Alternatively, are some of the destinations I chose (like Split or Sarajevo) worth the amount of time I'm devoting to them? 2. Are Hvar and Korcula the recommended islands?

There are some great nearby beaches and you can get a roundtrip taxi boat to nearby islands for 10-20 Euros. For a beautiful lesser-known beach, check out Mlini beach. Also worth catching a boat tour to explore the caves and nearby islands. I did a 6-hour boat tour that was well worth the money. Dubrovnik was great. I spent three nights there and found more to do there than Split and Hvar. Expensive and touristy but plenty to do. Great nearby beaches and plenty of great restaurants & bars.

n2cs3iy,"Hi! American living in the UK here. I would like to emphasize how hostile to walking cities are in the US. Walking in most of these cities just isn't feasible for doing more than essentially the high street. What I mean by that is that in places like Nashville and Austin you physically cannot get from some points to another without a car as you'd be walking along major highways which is illegal. Additionally these cities are spread out, let's say you're staying in Colorado Springs downtown area, it will take about 2hrs to get to the Red Rock Canyon entrance walking, and the walk isn't through picturesque scenes it's grueling suburbia at best. Public transit is irregular, unreliable, and has large gaps in availability. They also don't have regular stops in the same way as the UK, you could still be looking at a 30-1hr long walk as your closest bus stop. So you'll be relying on Ubers a lot to get to and from places. The issue with that, if you're looking to hike in nearby national parks/forests is that you run the risk of getting stranded as the drive out may not be worth the time for the drivers to come pick you up. Vegas, Savannah, and New Orleans are the only cities I would find doable without a car, and in these places you'll not be in the outdoors like national parks, they also have heavy party/drinking cultures.

Fluffy sheep ‚Äì their fleece turned to clouds by the sun ‚Äì grazed on gorse beside the coastal path.

Low tide unveiled the path to Worm‚Äôs Head. Bare feet met astonishingly fine sand ‚Äì nothing like Britain‚Äôs usual pebbly shores. Wading across the exposed seabed toward the dragonshaped island, tiny crabs scuttled over barnacled rocks. A distant shout made me turn: white foam was racing toward the causeway! I sprinted back, trainers in hand, heart drumming. Nearly became a reallife castaway ‚Äì Robinson Crusoe vibes unintended! Back in Swansea for the evening, neon lights glowed at the indoor market. At the ‚ÄúGower Power‚Äù stall, a tenner bought a mountain of mussels and chips (¬£10). Squashed at a communal table, sharing chili sauce with Welsh students, my phone buzzed: ‚ÄúThose cliff sheep on your Insta!

I'm hoping I'll be back to normal soon, but either way, I can't let this stop me travelling! (other than the trip to Portugal I had to cancel). I'm hoping I can go away later this year but will have to see how things go. I wanted to ask what the best destinations are for someone who will be potentially on crutches (or at least less mobile)? I'm not sure what the criteria would be - walkable but also good public transport/taxis, general attitudes, lots of public seating, good healthcare, dry weather and probably other stuff I'm not thinking of. I live in the UK so anywhere in Europe is ideal. I've also been thinking of Canada and Hong Kong, and would love to go back to Vietnam but don't think that is a great option right now. I'm in the early stages of planning so don't really have a budget, maybe ¬£1000-2000 for flights/accomm/spending for a week or so (which would be Europe only really).

n2awx1g,"Paris is beyond friendly. In Paris, being disabled is a legit super power. Paris is notorious for long lines to major attractions. But with a disability, you can forget about all the lines, having to make reservations at most attractions, and even paying! I wrote a whole trip report about this on Tripadvisor. The one caveat is that you have to have ""proof"" of your disability, such a disability card, or a medical letter. We don't have that in the US, but a car handicapped placard worked. But only once or twice did they even ask. When they saw my partner's gait, they usually immediately ushered both of us to the front and right through the door no questions asked. Oh yes, and one other person with the disabled traveler gets to go along for the ride -free entry and skip all lines. I know this is a solo travel sub, but if you can coral a companion, it's an excellent chance for them to experience Paris without the usual annoyances of the hideous lines. Public transit and healthcare are excellent. The only thing is that there are few elevators to the Metro. However, buses are frequent and reliable, and the Bonjour RATP app tells you exactly how to get from any point to any other point -much better than google. \*The only caveat... not sure if a temporary disability counts. But if you have a doctor's letter, you should be good. \*Second small caveat... they won't let you go to the very top level of the Eiffel Tower. We finagled it anyway, but it was technically not allowed. Otherwise, they'll bend over backwards to accommodate you. As your disability is temporary, I would even say you should seize the day because you'll (hopefully) never have another opportunity like this to skip all the lines in places like the Louvre and Versailles.",positive,positive,0.9021,positive,0.9991
n29r4rz,"Good on you for keeping up the travel! I broke my leg quite badly a few years ago, it took me about a year to travel solo (it was easier with family/friends). I think you could consider smaller-sized cities as I find capitals or big cities tend to be quite busy and require a lot of walking. Bilbao meets all your criteria for example, you could visit Santander too. Majorca is nice, though you'd rely more on taxis and some parts are hilly (same with Tenerife, or Corfu). I really struggled with confidence and anxiety, so make sure you choose somewhere there is less of a language barrier and where they have a lot of tourists - and adapt your expectations. It's worth telling your accomodation you're on crutches so they don't put you on the fourth floor or something. For the airport, I recommend going to the assistance part, they'll give a sunflower lanyard which means you can go in the assistance lane through security which is much quicker and generally the staff will give you a bit more time. You put your crutches through the scanner, they give you a stick to walk through if you need. In the airplane you'll put them in the overhead luggage compartment. For insurance, if it was less than 4 months ago (or if you still have follow-up) you have to announce it but it barely makes any difference to the cost. Let me know if you have any more questions!

So if you're going, at least have some day trips planned if you're not staying on one of the surrounding islands. I was lucky enough to be hanging with some locals at the time, so I ate REALLY well. :D * Sandakan, don't spend too much time in the town itself, the Orangutan and Sunbear sanctuaries close by are worth it but you don't need more than half a day to do them both. Double check the feeding times for the Orangutans as you'll plan your day by that. The pick up to the Kinabatangan river safari was from here. I recommend doing 2 nights as you have more chance to see the animals, the 1 night feels very rushed. *Kota Kinabalu - it's a small city, so lots of malls etc. Many many food options. The tours to the islands didn't get good reviews because I think they are just very busy. I did a sunset tour around the mangroves to see the fireflies, which I personally really enjoyed. The sunset beach was very busy, again, so I didn't get many good pics. I really wish I had the budget and time to climb Mount Kinabalu, so might have to go back one day. What surprised me about Sabah in general was how busy it is. All the cities and towns were also incredibly polluted, with Semporna being the worst I've ever seen.

I had to book a day diving off Sipadan (they limit the number of divers per day) to get the Sipadan permit and it was just meh. Indo is great I went right after Borneo (flew from Kuching to Jakarta) loved Yogyakarta & the Ijen plateau. Bali & Lombok were great and diving in Komodo National Park was amazing.

Edit: Not to be a dick, and I hope you enjoyed your time here, and as a responsible visitor. Norway has, like a lot of countries, had an influx of tourisme, both local and foreign. Especially the nature in north is sought after. The thing is, the infrastructure is not set up for this, and it has been cracking for a while now, trying to accommodate more visitors as that brings in revenue, but being poorly underfunded from the state for that. New regulations are coming. We also have this ""right to roam"" that secures access to nature for all, but it does have regulations, and please follow those. Its on how far away from a building you can stay, on what kind of land you can stay, and for how long. This is really getting abused and not followed, and if it continues we could lose this right in certain areas. Like everywhere else, act as if you are visiting, be respectful of the laws and regulations, carry out your rubbish and shit, and do leave some money behind locally. Small places have small budgets, but has to try to have service and infrastructure to a whole hoard of visitors not paying tax to that purpose. Dont feed the huge chains like supermarkets and Airbnb, but think small and local. Airbnb is here like everywhere helping to drive out locals. Other than that, please come! I recommend going in shoulder seasons, if thinking up north or the west coast. Cheaper and way way less busy. Lofoten started to fill up 15 years ago, now its madness.

1lvm3dn,"I‚Äôve been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina and rolled into Villa O‚ÄôHiggins with no time to spare. This was the end of the Carretera Austral, a small, sobering harbor at the bottom of a grueling 800-mile marathon down the Chilean side of Patagonia. The only way south from there was bookending two ferry connections with the most remote hike-a-bike border crossing of my entire life, a section I‚Äôd dreamt of since setting out from the Arctic Ocean. Traversing Lago Desierto is a very specific badge of bikepacking honor. Like many modernizing nations, Argentina‚Äôs immigrations system has gone entirely digital [to the dismay of colorful passport stamp chasers]. But in the glacial wilderness surrounding Mount Fitz Roy lies a tiny customs shack so isolated that they still use the faded old stamps and crumpled ledgers we‚Äôve come to love. It‚Äôs a special kind of prize that I‚Äôd long looked forward to. More than a keepsake. A ceremony. Approaching the Antarctic Islands and Tierra del Fuego meant that weather here was torrential at best, severely unpredictable. Sailors refer to these latitudes as the ‚ÄúRoaring Forties‚Äù and ‚ÄúFurious Fifties.‚Äù Centuries of hardy fear have instilled the old mariner‚Äôs proverb: ‚ÄúBelow 40 degrees there is no law, and below 50 degrees there is no God.‚Äù Boat services across Lago O‚ÄôHiggins vary by the wind and can be delayed by up to a week at a time. I lucked out with a ticket first, then again with a nearby bike mechanic who lent a few more spokes to spare. Everything was broken. Rain gear, no longer waterproof. My bike had grown resistant to the finish line, it seemed. And in some ways I had as well. A ragged band of cyclists and backpackers stumbled aboard, all having started from various points in different countries, but all en route to El Chalt√©n. We piled everyone‚Äôs gear inside a cramped passenger ferry and lashed our bikes to a railing above its helm, chopping across the first lake at breakneck speed towards a lonesome dock named Candelario Mancilla and the Fitz Roy backcountry beyond.",negative,positive,0.9397,negative,0.8579

1lvrf8v,"Hey guys! I just went on an awesome backpacking trip over the 4th of July weekend and wanted to share. I spent 3 days in the Jennie Lakes Wilderness and had perfect conditions. Bluebird skies, 60-degree temps, alpine lake swims, and zero stress. I recently co-created an outdoor app called Fethr which I used to plan my trip and I wanted to share that experience. Maybe it can help you on your future trips! I used Fethr‚Äôs route creation feature and trail map to help me decide where I wanted to go. I settled on a scenic loop through Jennie Lakes, camping at a different lake each night. I ended up with an itinerary of 6.6 miles the first day from Big Meadows Trailhead to Jennie Lake, 8.7 miles from Jennie Lake through JO Pass to Weaver Lake on the second day, and wrapped up the trip with 3.4 miles back to the trailhead on the last day. The route creation allowed me to use custom waypoints showing my camping spots and parking on the map, while also showing each day‚Äôs mileage and elevation summary. Once I had my route dialed in, I created a trip report in Fethr to organize all the key details: trailhead info, daily itinerary, camp spots, and notes. Knowing I‚Äôd be off-grid, I also downloaded the offline map of the area, which ended up working great because I lost signal as soon as I passed through the entrance of Sequoia National Park on my way to the trailhead. Using the offline maps, custom routes and tracking, I could follow along with my route without getting lost. Which was a blessing in disguise, because I noticed that JO Pass seems to be a lot less traveled than the trail to both Jennie and Weaver Lakes. There were a few times where I didn‚Äôt notice a turn and started hiking off trail, but was able to quickly get back on track by looking at my route. I also created a dedicated pack with gear pulled straight from my Gear List. Since this was a holiday weekend and not too many miles each day, I decided to bring a few ‚Äúluxury‚Äù items with me, including fishing gear and a floatie for the lake. I wanted to try my hand at fishing and although I was able to successfully cast, I couldn‚Äôt find any interested fish. I did look around for some trout while on the floatie, but it seems the fish may be sparse. The views in the Sierras never disappoint, and this trip was no exception. If you are able to, I definitely recommend taking the longer loop from Jennie Lake through the JO Pass and over to Weaver Lake. There are some steep inclines, but the creek crossings and mountain views make it all worth it. I uploaded my favorite photos into that same trip report I mentioned earlier, so it‚Äôs all there to revisit whenever I want to look back on this trip. I also shared the trip on my Fethr profile, so others in the community can check it out and maybe even use it as a jumping-off point for their own adventure. This trip reminded me why I love backpacking, but it also showed me how much smoother it can be when the logistics are handled. Fethr kept me organized, safe, and in the moment. It was just me, the forest, and the freedom to enjoy it all. **TL;DR:** Jennie Lakes Wilderness is absolutely beautiful and I used Fethr to help me plan smarter, hike safer, and enjoy every moment without getting bogged down by logistics. If you haven‚Äôt used the app for a full trip yet, do it. This one felt effortless, and I‚Äôm already dreaming up the next one.

I hiked Hilton Lake during 4th of July last year and the mosquitos were so bad that we were stuck in our tent as soon as it started getting dark and had to outrun them the next morning, so Jennie Lake was a breath of fresh air haha.

Some people set up their day pack as a front pack, connecting it to their sternum and waist strap of their larger pack.

Emergency Medical Insurance:** That's another issue entirely. I travel to a lot of developing countries and sometimes I'm doing stuff (like motorcycling, etc.) that increases risk. If a medical emergency happens then I instantly want the best care possible, including emergency medivac (which is insanely expensive) to a centre with real medical facilities. I also want repatriation insurance to get me home. This is especially important at a destination with little or no medical infrastructure, or a country like the US where medical care is insanely expensive. (One example, in Mongolia one of my film crew suffered an accident and the emergency medivac to Bangkok cost over $70K USD, completely paid for by my insurance. It saved her leg though, and maybe even her life.) **Bottom line:** Insurance is the most useless waste of money you can spend on your trip, *until an emergency happens,* then of course it's the best investment you ever made.

In my experience nature centric trips unfortunately kind of revolve around getting into a car, unless you‚Äôre staying in a more tropical place, but then it‚Äôs hot lol. Ok, so since you said it doesn‚Äôt have to be all the above, these are my main thoughts: Costa Rica: Hear me out. I‚Äôm also from the NE/US and since you say you don‚Äôt drive I‚Äôm going to take the risk and assume that like me, you have mostly grown up/lived in NE cities. The oppressive city heat we feel in summer here is not the same as the low 80s winter heat with a sea breeze there. Especially surrounded by nature and not concrete. I would suggest booking a dead winter, early December or February (i.e., when the kids are not on winter break) trip, when the weather is in the low 80s, right by Manuel Antonio, or the Cloud Forest, or one of the many awesome nature filled/surrounded towns many people here or the internet can recommend and get your nature fantasy on. Here‚Äôs why I think CR specifically despite the fact it‚Äôs tropical: 1. It‚Äôs super safe and you‚Äôll feel totally at ease as a female solo traveler. 2. You can travel at all different budgets. It‚Äôs not crazy cheap, but you can easily find a beautiful, but simple room, surrounded by nature at like $80 a night. Plus flights are cheap outside of holidays/winter break. 3. You can usually walk around the towns and people are really friendly, there‚Äôs usually a very relaxed vibe in most spots. Like you can walk to a really tasty/cozy breakfast spot, take a cab or bus to the beach, have an awesome lunch of a grilled tuna burger, cab or take a long walk back to your room, and then have 5 or 10 options of restaurants that are a 5 minute walk or a short cab ride away. More if you‚Äôre willing to adventure further. 4. It‚Äôs crazy relaxing while also being one of the most nature oriented places I‚Äôve been. Like you can‚Äôt leave your bathing suit to dry outside because the monkeys will steal it, but you can also sit on your terrace and watch them play in the trees in the evening while having a glass of wine. I also loved finding this little hiking trail to a little beach that we would hang out at all day, then explore around the rocks of the bay, or swim, or read. 5 bucks got you your chair and umbrella for the day. Another 10 was a drink and your burger. I think the country has found a good balance of not overdeveloping tourism wise (at least from what I saw). That‚Äôs what I think of when I want to decompress.

It actually snows and gets fairly cold in the winter, so a late summer/fall trip could be perfect for you. - Don‚Äôt drive: if you stay in a central part of Santa Fe, this shouldn‚Äôt be a huge problem. A lot of the main destinations are walkable and it‚Äôs pretty easy to get Ubers to areas that are a bit further out. I‚Äôm guessing there are also companies that offer tours to surrounding areas so that you don‚Äôt have to drive yourself. - Budget: many folks will say Santa Fe can be pricey, and that‚Äôs true, but I believe it‚Äôs possible to do it on a budget as well. After that, Santa Fe checks ALL your boxes. Outstanding food, very very quirky and interesting people, extremely friendly, slow pace, incredible art and museums, lots of live music, beautiful Southwestern architecture. Lots of local hotels and Airbnbs to choose from. If this interests you, here are some things to look into: - El Rey Hotel: cute hotel, centrally located, great bar where a lot of locals gather to hang out. - Georgia O‚ÄôKeefe Museum, Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Museum of International Folk Art, NM Museum of Art, Santa Fe Botanic Gardens. Great cafe up on Museum Hill too. - Meow Wolf - Galleries on Canyon Road - 10,000 Waves Spa - The Plaza and the Railyard of course, lots of shops, restaurants, music, bars, people, etc. - Take a ride on the Sky Railway with a history, stargazing, or scenery-focused tour - Valentina‚Äôs restaurant for a casual New Mexican meal, Time Travelers Gastropub for British pub food and interesting people.

Bear in mind there can be a lot of noise (open-air nightclubs until 5am, late-night bars, etc.). High-end options are Hotel Humano in La Punta and Casa Joseph in Zicatela. A good mid-range option is Hotel Raiz, in Brisas de Zicatela. 2. Food is similarly wide-ranging, beachside I would recommend La Olita in La Punta, and an amazing gem is Fish Shack, in a small alley also in La Punta. Bear in mind the sea can be very rough (red flag every day, but that didn't prevent people from swimming). 3. Be very careful of pack dogs. People are bitten very often (last Saturday it happened to my girlfriend). Go to Dr Diego or Dr Karla in Brisas, next to Pharma Puento, should it happen. Open on Sundays as well. 4. Lots of excursions are available, from swimming with dolphins to turtle release, bioluminescence, etc. Check Viator and GetYourGuide. -- Have a fantastic stay in PE!",positive,positive,0.9817,positive,0.9995

1lttned,"Hi everyone, my partner and I are planning a 3-week camping trip this September with our tent. We‚Äôll be driving from the Netherlands and want to roadtrip through a country, mainly focused on nature and hiking. We're currently debating between Slovenia and Slovakia. To give you an idea of our travel style: we love doing 3-6 hour hikes in the mountains most days, and after we just chill at our tent (board games, reading, drink some local wine/beer, cooking our own meals on a shitty camping stove). We change campings every 3-5 days. On rainy days, we don‚Äôt mind visiting a museum, church, or caf√© but you'll mostly find us in nature. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs important to us: * **Beautiful nature hikes**. We prefer trails that aren‚Äôt overly artificial or paved. Mountains, creeks, waterfalls, and dazzling views make us very happy. The hikes dont need to be hardcore, just pretty. üòä * **Safety.** It must be 100% safe. From what I‚Äôve read, both countries seem fine in that regard. * **Peaceful green campsites**. We love quiet, nature-based campsites. We don‚Äôt mind basic facilities and older bathrooms. * **Less touristy**. I know touristic places are popular for a reason, but we‚Äôd rather avoid long lines, which is also why we are going in September. Some tourism is fine if can beat the crowds by going early. * **Basic English (or Dutch or French).** We don‚Äôt need fluency, but we prefer when people understand a few basic English words so we can order bread and such. * **Friendly people**. Not the most important point since we‚Äôll mostly be in nature, but it is highly appreciated. I heard some mixed messages about Slovakians being rude to tourists? We may spend one day in Bratislava or Ljubljana but city life or good food is not very important to us. Both countries are well within our budget. Both Slovenia and Slovakia seem to tick most of our boxes. The Julian Alps and the Tatra mountains both look stunning and neither seem very touristic. We are having a hard time choosing! What would you recommend?",positive,positive,0.9991,positive,0.9992

You can drive endlessly and encounter gorgeous scenery, lovely mountains, rivers. Bohinj had the vibe you are explaining for sure. There were a lot of sporty adventuring people biking, hiking, swimming, paddle boarding, camping. We stayed at a cute and rustic cabin right near the lake and swam every day on the lake in the mountains. There are also many gorge and waterfall hikes that we really enjoyed. You mentioned rain days, and one thing that I noticed was that in Slovenia we had many rain days, however it didn't seem to really hold people back at all. They'd be all geared up with rain gear and biking and hiking away. We actually did a hike in the full on rain, at Slap Savica to a beautiful waterfall. We also hiked Mostnica Gorge in the rain.

Enjoyed doing this in Europe via trains - Not into beaches - Not into drinking/bars/clubbing (but potentially interested in hearing local music styles played at them) - Interested in: museums, historical sites, hiking, cool architecture, and just walking aimlessly around cities and towns finding interesting things to do and experiencing local street life Argentina or Peru seems promising?",positive,positive,0.9971,positive,0.9993

We (2 adults) did manage approx 200 euro per day simply for food & room (with some leeway, Venice is expensive), but do keep in mind the additional transport costs and the expensive museums and such in Venice, plus tourist taxes and so on (also car hire with the deposit). Personally I would wait to rent a car until you get to Slovenia since it's a lot cheaper compared to Italy, so the rest of your budget will no longer simply be car costs. Going from Venice to Ljubljana is pretty easy, I did it by train in a couple of hours not that long ago. Lake Bled is beautiful and I highly recommend it (also less hot than Ljubljana). Tons of easy day hikes and interesting spots in the area. Slovenia is tiny and generally not really touristy in that way beyond the center of Ljubljana, so if you have a car you can see a lot of it if you pick a good place to base out of. Places like the Vitngar gorge (near Bled) or Predjama castle & the caves are great. Also, do you need to go back to Venice to fly out?

n1iby35,"Looks like a well-paced itinerary, and you‚Äôre already ahead of the curve by building in time to wander and not overpack the days. After helping thousands plan their Europe trips through Guide to Europe, I‚Äôve seen the same pattern again and again: the itineraries with a little breathing room tend to be the ones people remember most. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd think about your stops: **Vienna:** This city really shines when you slow down. One museum or palace, followed by a caf√© and a long walk, is more than enough for a full day. Sperl and Vollpension are both great for something classic but low-key, and the 7th district is worth a wander if you‚Äôre after a quieter local feel. **Budapest:** The baths and ruin bars are fun, but what tends to stick, for me and for a lot of travelers I‚Äôve talked to, is the slower side. Riding Tram 2 by the river at golden hour, grabbing dinner on the Buda side where it‚Äôs calmer. Pozsonyi Kisvend√©gl≈ë is one I always recommend. Simple, local, and never too crowded. **Paris:** It‚Äôs clich√© for a reason. The planned stops always deliver, but what stays with you tends to be the detours: a canal-side bakery you stumble on, a quiet caf√© where time slows down. You‚Äôve built in space for those kinds of moments, and that‚Äôs where Paris really opens up. **General tip:** Resist the urge to optimize every day. Let the trip breathe. The best feedback we hear from travelers is usually something like, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see everything, but I actually felt like I was there.‚Äù",positive,positive,0.9876,positive,0.9923

n1pos38,"essay incoming because i love budapest Sightseeing - Make sure to see the castle, matyas church, and st istvan‚Äôs basilica (you can do all this in one day easily) - avoid fisherman‚Äôs bastion, it‚Äôs overpriced and nothing special - in the castle district there‚Äôs a Marcipan cafe, it‚Äôs very good - Make sure to go to the Libego Chairlift, you can take the 291 bus from Nyugati Train Station, from there you can walk around 1km to see the Erzsebet lookout with a great view (half a day) - Spend one day just in the city center, you can take the metro to Fovam Ter and walk down Vaci Utca, it‚Äôs very nice, Additionally walk down Andrassy Ut to the end and you will get to Hosok Tere, a great monument (I don‚Äôt recommend taking the metro there, it‚Äôs only a 15m walk and it‚Äôs very nice) Additionally the 2 tram from Jaszai Mari Ter to Fovam Ter is very beautiful but not past that - Please don‚Äôt do any tour bus like hop on hop off etc, they all are not worth it Food - The best places for dinner are Menza, Ket Szerecsen (both near Oktogon Metro), and Notafa (Go to Hatar Ut Metro and take the 42 tram) They all have traditional hungarian food and are not touristy at all seriously trust me on these - At the basilica, DiVino is a great place for a drink - I wouldn‚Äôt recommend New York Cafe, it‚Äôs expensive and very overrated - The best Retes (strudel) is at Lepeny&Retes on Kiraly Utca - Make sure to try pogacsa, you can get some at fornetti which is at many metro stations - When on andrassy ut, go to muvesz cafe, it‚Äôs near the opera house General - Don‚Äôt use taxis or the sort, public transport is amazing, just get a day pass every day and use google maps for routes - Customer service is terrible, so if a waiter/cashier etc is rude don‚Äôt take it personally, it‚Äôs part of the‚Ä¶ charm? (bus drivers too especially) - Dont stay at a fancy hotel (or even a hotel for that matter, in my opinion, find a panzio, which is basically a private owned motel, and book there) If youd like I can recommend some - Budapest is great at night just avoid the area around Blaha Lujza Ter I saw another comment say this and honestly i have to agree, while vienna is nice it‚Äôs only really a one day thing for me, more is unnecesary, id add another day to hungary and do this: - Get up early, and get on a train to Pecs (Leaves from keleti train station, get tickets a day before) It‚Äôs about a 2hr train ride, and it‚Äôs a small town that is absolutely incredible, it has a fort and is a completely different feel to budapest as well as having turkish influence. Make sure to see the minaret + go to a turkish tea tent. You can eat at excalibur which is an awesome themed restaurant with great food, and take a late train back.

1lphrzt,"We visited Ecuador as part of our 3 year around the world trip (currently on month 11 and 11th country). Most people associate Ecuador with the Gal√°pagos Islands. For budget reasons, we went almost everywhere *except* there this time ‚Äî we‚Äôll come back specifically for them and give them the special attention they deserve in the future. The continental part of Ecuador has *so much* to offer for all lovers of nature, hiking, and exotic vibes mixed with modern comfort. Crossing from the Peru-Ecuador border felt like travelling 15‚Äì20 years into the future. Almost every small town here could outshine the big Peruvian cities in terms of organization, cleanliness, and convenience. The people are kinder and don‚Äôt see many tourists, and even though prices are in dollars, everyday costs are much more affordable. It is also way quieter in terms of traffic, honking and music, but still it's LATAM - it's difficult to escape from the dogs, roosters and the cumbia. In the very south, around Vilcabamba and Loja, is Ecuador‚Äôs coffee region, where we spent nearly a week hopping between different fincas and trying all kinds of first-class coffee. Unfortunately, outside Europe, espresso isn‚Äôt really a thing, and the best varieties are offered only as filter coffee (this applies to every country we‚Äôve visited so far). We got tired of it, so we bought our own grinder and a portable espresso machine (Picopresso). Things are now easier and happier for everyone involved. Ecuador also produces the highest-quality cacao in the world, and in every town you‚Äôll find countless brand-name chocolate shops ‚Äî each better than the last. We stocked up with over a kilo of chocolate: we‚Äôve got ones with green olives, juniper, salt, raw cacao, passionfruit, allspice, rose, 100% pure bars, and who knows what else. The flavor combos are endless ‚Äî only your imagination is the limit. But the most amazing thing here is the *biodiversity* ‚Äî just walking around each day, you see 5‚Äì10 new species of birds and butterflies, not to mention the plants. In Mindo, we even rented a private hacienda with its own jungle ‚Äî a few acres you could freely roam and watch the birds go by undirsturbed. We managed to snap a photo of the famous toucan, as well as several incredibly interesting butterflies ‚Äî including the caligo butterfly. If you Google it now, it‚Äôll say Ecuador is a dangerous country to visit (Level 3). That‚Äôs because of drug trafficking issues along the coast, but inland there's absolutely no trouble. At every turn we‚Äôre met with kindness and politeness, and people are always ready to help if you need anything. Like in any LATAM country, without Spanish you‚Äôre not getting far ‚Äî but after 5 months on the continent, we‚Äôre at around B1 level and nothing is stopping us now. The route was: Vilcabamba - Loja - Cuenca - Banos - Quilotoa - Quito - Mindo - Otavalo Ecuador turned out surprisingly cheap, despite all the wild stuff we did: We did a 3-day trek around a volcano, sleeping in tiny villages; went whitewater rafting (level 4); drank every type of coffee and craft beer imaginable; spent 2 nights in a private jungle; and ate shrimp until we nearly burst. Worth noting ‚Äî in Quito we stayed 4 days with family friends who covered everything, but even without those 4 days, the stats speak for themselves: **Days in Ecuador:** 29 **Accommodation:** \~$327 USD **Food:** \~$403 USD **Transport:** \~$140 USD **Activities:** \~$84 USD **Substances:** \~$190 USD **Fees/Taxes:** \~$8.50 USD **Souvenirs:** \~$48 USD **Luxury:** \~$101 USD **Other:** \~$28 USD **Total:** **\~$1,330 USD** / **\~$45.90 USD per day for both people** **Next stop ‚Äî Colombia!**",positive,positive,0.9348,positive,0.9954

A little background: Her job requires her to be on-site and she doesn't like it anyway so she'll quit, and she's contemplating on what she wants to do if and when we'll try to move. My job is hybrid and can be remote-only so I'll be ""the"" digital nomad"". We have a few ""requirements"" from the places we want to visit, and I would love some input from the community: 1. Budget - I make let's say around 6-8k$ a month after taxes. Currently our monthly living expenses where we live now (not Europe) is around 3-4k$ (including random buys, personal stuff, restaurants, etc.). We split the expenses and I need to take into account that she won't work until she finds what she wants to do so we're looking for a place that you can live on a 3-4k$ monthly budget. 2. Traveling - We want to be digital nomads to travel the world, and Europe is the closest thing to us now so we're looking at it. We want places where we can do stuff (attractions, food, etc) on the weekends or evenings. Maybe this is obvious? I don't know. 3. Transportation - We're not going to rent a car or anything like that, so at least at the start, we want to live in a metropolitan area with good public transportation that we can rely on. 4. Safety - We have enough safety issues where we currently live, and we want to escape these sort of things. Safety should maybe even be first on the list, it shouldn't even be a question. 5. Visa - obviously the countries should have a digital nomad visa, that allows my GF to join me as well. IDK if this is obvious as well, thought to mention it regardless.

Now, with my sister planning to return to Europe for her university studies, we think it's the perfect moment for my mom to also come back. She‚Äôs looking for a fresh start, and I truly believe she‚Äôd be an ideal fit as a permanent co-host for someone managing multiple Airbnb listings. She speaks fluent English and conversational Spanish. She‚Äôs responsible, detail-oriented, deeply kind, and knows what exceptional guest service looks like ‚Äì both from a hotel/event perspective and as a human being. If you‚Äôre looking for a trustworthy, experienced, and genuinely lovely person to help co-manage your listings (whether it‚Äôs guest communication, turnovers, problem-solving, etc.), or know someone who is, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. We‚Äôre open to any European location and various co-living/co-working arrangements. Thank you so much for reading ‚Äì happy to share more details via DM!

I think it's more common in immigrant/traditional families. For context; I work remotely for a tech company in Asia and I'm in my latest 20s. Last year I escaped for a few months to Southeast Asia, lived better, spent less, and honestly felt happy again. That experience opened my eyes, and I‚Äôve been planning to do it again this year. It's not just about pleasure; I wanna eventually leave Canada and settle somewhere else. I also have friends in Asia. My parents? Absolutely HATE it. When I lost my job later that year because they company went bankrupt (different company), they immediately blamed the whole thing on me going to Asia and said I should return and not do this thing again. Zero emotional support. Now they are saying I will lose this job because I have bad luck and should just settle in Canada and forget about these adventures. They don't even like living in Canada because of the weather and bad economy and politics, but I guess we gotta suffer together. I‚Äôm still going, their opinion won‚Äôt change my plans.

n2aqck3,"I've never had guilt about other people choosing to have different lifestyles to me. If they have opinions, they're more than welcome to keep it to themselves. If they can't manage that, then they simply don't get to have opportunities to interact with me until they learn. There's no guilt, no self-recrimination, no feeling down about it. It's just acknowledgement that, family or no, people are individuals and can't be expected to be exactly as I might personally like them to be. And that's OK. And correspondingly, I'm not somehow obliged to make them part of my life, regardless of their opinion on that. ---- Sure, it can be a little sad if someone I liked or admired doesn't want to support me to the extent that they think they have to constantly open their mouths about their opinions on my choices, but in the end that's their call. And it's my call as to who I want to spend time interacting with. Being a person I grew up with or am otherwise related to doesn't come with any privilege in that respect other than having had a much earlier introduction. I'm perfectly OK with dropping someone out of my life entirely after 40 years or more if we end up going in sufficiently incompatible directions. There's no 'Oh I could never do that because of our shared history.' They get the same as anyone else on the about-to-be-dropped list; a one-on-one, sit-down session where I lay out the problem - there's always the chance that they honestly did not know what was going on - and they get the (unspoken) opportunity to realize what they've been doing and maybe decide to change. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. If they don't, then I guess they didn't value the relationship, so there's no reason I particularly should either. There are eight billion other people in the world I could be connecting with if I particularly want a stand-in replacement; statistics alone say that there are hundreds, if not thousands of people out there who would do a better job of being whatever that person meant to me. ---- And, funnily enough, the people who thought they could *never* be dropped because they were family get really annoyed when they're told, calmly, that they've been replaced because I found someone who was just flat-out a better (friend, cousin, parent) than they were.

Been having the worst luck here in Indonesia - cliffs notes version: 5 days after coming to Bali was walking on the beach minding my own business when a dog grabbed my hand randomly and put teeth marks requiring me to get rabies shots and throwing all my plans haywire. Then I was in Gili T and my cruise that I had booked from there to Lombok was cancelled on the morning of the departure due to a busted engine. Left me scramming to make alternate plans which was really stressful. Then in Komodo when getting back an hour before my flight the volcano on Flores island decided to blow it's top raining ash down completely shutting down the airport and cancelling all flights. Again left me scramming to make alternate plans, I was stuck on Flores for 2 days as airlines were price gouging when the airport reopened. Had 14 months of relatively trouble free travel and then a whole month with a string of things going wrong.

One thing I've learned over the years is to ask ""how do you do"" (or Joey's ""how you doin'"") and listen, instead of ""what do you do"". Similarly, I'm more genuinely engaged in conversations when people seek to connect with me through shared values rather than status trading such as job title, postcode, or name dropping.

Your years in sales, what is that worth on the job market? A superstar sales person can make a lot of money, but talent is more important than experience. How good are you at sales? Are you good enough to convince someone to hire you to sell remotely? Can you monetize your Spanish? For example, are you good enough at it to teach it? iTalki is an example of how competitive the freelance marketplace is.

Take one of the lower paying positions ($14.00 an hour USD is low), settle in somewhere in the world for a bit, particularly a low cost country with a lot of digital nomads. Make some friends, ask around, and you'll eventually find what you're looking for. It's good to just make those friends as they'll tend to direct you a bit. You don't need a lot of money to be overseas, but if you have obligations (such as debts) back home, that can be a huge burden, so I'd settle all that while you're still there. $14.00 is really low, but that's sort of the entry position these days. At that point, just enjoy the ocean or work your network. You can expect to get $20-$30 an hour once you're fully into it. I live in Da Nang Vietnam, I pay $250.00 USD a month, and I spend around $175.00 on food a week, and the best coffee in the world. I'm also a tall, fitness oriented person so I eat a lot.

We were aiming for a mix of city life, skiing, and some more relaxed local experiences ‚Äî and it turned out to be an awesome balance. **‚úàÔ∏è Trip Overview** **When:** January 2025 **Where:** Tokyo ‚Üí Kyoto ‚Üí Niseko ‚Üí Sapporo **Length:** 15 days **Where we stayed:** Airbnb + hotels **üóº Days 1‚Äì4: Tokyo (Ikebukuro**) * Flew into Haneda (HND) ‚Äî way easier than Narita if you're headed into central Tokyo * Stayed in an Airbnb in Ikebukuro ‚Äî felt like a slightly more local Shinjuku * Tons of bars, great food, and super convenient train access **Quick tip:** Add a Suica card to your Apple/Google Wallet before arriving. It makes transit way easier ‚Äî no more fumbling with machines. **Weather:** Cold but manageable. Bring layers and a warm coat, especially at night. **‚õ©Ô∏è Days 4‚Äì7: Kyoto** * Took the Shinkansen down from Tokyo ‚Äî easy and scenic * Stayed near Higashiyama, which ended up being our favorite part of the city **Kyoto favorites:** * Fushimi Inari Shrine (go early ‚Äî sunrise was peaceful and almost empty) * %ARABICA coffee with a view of the river * Rocking Bar ING ‚Äî Favorite bar in Kyoto * Wandering along Shijo Street for snacks and shopping * Bamboo Forest in Arashiyama was fine, but wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way for it next time **üéø Days 7‚Äì12: Nisek**o * Flew from HND to Sapporo (CTS), then took a bus to Niseko * Stayed near the slopes with ski-in/ski-out access **Niseko thoughts:** * Snow was incredible ‚Äî no surprise there * Not ideal if you're looking for nightlife or restaurants beyond the resort * Buses stop running pretty early (\~7PM), and taxis are tough to find * If you care more about skiing than nightlife, it‚Äôs perfect * I‚Äôve also skied in Hakuba ‚Äî personally liked the terrain and apr√®s scene there better **Tip:** Book your bus from CTS to Niseko well ahead of time, especially if you‚Äôre going during ski season. **üèôÔ∏è Days 12‚Äì15: Sappor**o * Stayed in an Airbnb downtown * The city felt like a mini Tokyo ‚Äî way more relaxed and really walkable **Sapporo highlights:** * Ramen alley near Susukino * Sapporo Beer Hall (a little touristy, but still fun) * The underground mall network is HUGE ‚Äî great for when it's freezing outside **Overall take:** This trip hit everything we were hoping for ‚Äî good balance of big cities, cultural spots, and snow.

I signed a tenancy agreement in September 2024 through an agent who claimed to represent the owner (who lives in China). The agreement was signed by the ‚Äúowner‚Äù and stamped by LHDN. The agent provided their own bank details for rent and deposit payments, claiming they were the owner‚Äôs representative in Malaysia. I negotiated a deal to pay a full year‚Äôs rent in advance, along with the deposit, and made the payment by November 2024. However, in December 2024, I was contacted by a new agent claiming to represent the owner. They said the owner never received any money and that the previous agent forged the agreement. The owner also reached out to me, confirming this claim and saying they never signed the agreement. Now, the owner‚Äôs wife has contacted me, asking my family to leave the unit because they never received the rental payments. I‚Äôm worried they might demand rent from me again, even though I‚Äôve already paid in full to the first agent. What should I do in this situation? Can they ask me to leave, and am I required to pay the rent again? Thank you for your help.",positive,positive,0.7727,positive,0.9914

Slice the fish fillet into thin slices, rinse until clean, squeeze out the water as much as you can. Season with salt, pepper, cooking wine (optional), sichuan pepper grounds, and 1 egg white. Mix in one direction til fish slices thoroughly coated in egg white, then add 1 tbsp of corn starch, mix again til coated, and add 1 tbsp oil and mix again. Set fish aside. 3. (Optional) if you have fish bones and fish head, fry them in about 30ml of oil til golden brown, if no bones then skip. 4. Add 15g oil to pot, heat it and add chopped gingers, chilli, garlic, green onions, stir fry til fragrant, then add the Suancai into the pot and stir fry further. After a while when your room smells good, add 1L of boiling water (needs to be boiling), add salt pepper soy sauce msg to taste, and let the broth boil for 5mins. 5.

Once boiled again, turn off the heat (heat MUST be off) and put in the fish gently, do not move them too much once moved in and let them set shape. If you move them too much the coating of starch will seep into the broth and the fish seasoning will be washed away. 7. Let the fish sit for 1min, then slowly jiggle them and let them heat in the broth for another 2mins, make sure they‚Äôre heated evenly. After 2mins, take the fish out to the bowl you want to eat in, and leave the broth in the pot again and turn on heat and boil it another time. Once boiled, pour the broth straight into the bowl to cook the fish for a final time. 8.

1lwb0k2,Hi there I'm renting this landed house and have a tenancy agreement with landlord. The issue is our toilet water is too slow and flows like urine. Meaning it takes 10-20 minutes depending on the water tank water level to fill up. Furthermore our washing machine cannot be used because the water supply is too slow due to the tank water. I suggested owner to install water pump but he is mentioning it cost minimum 1.5k to install such water pump and he wouldn't have rented out the unit with the current price in first place. I would like to ask if I can enforce landlord to help install based on my tenancy agreement. This is because the water flow is very bad and not practical for us to wait so long daily.There is a clause mentioning the landlord must maintain the house in good and tenant able repair conditions such as water pipe drains and so on.

1lw7zlf,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a bit confused and wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar or knows what‚Äôs going on. I booked a flight that is operated by Asiana Airlines, but the ticket was issued by Hainan Airlines (so it‚Äôs a codeshare). I tried to upgrade my seat, either to extra legroom or even to another class, but I keep running into a wall. I called Asiana first, and they told me that the whole ticket is handled by Hainan, so they can‚Äôt upgrade anything because it‚Äôs not under their control. Then I called Hainan, and they said they can‚Äôt make any changes to the Asiana-operated flight either. Basically, both sides are telling me they can‚Äôt help. I was able to log in to the Asiana website with my booking reference, and I can see my flight details, but I can‚Äôt make any changes to the seat. I even asked if I could do it at the airport check-in counter, just pay extra there for a better seat, and they told me no. That part really surprised me. Like, if there are extra seats available and I‚Äôm willing to pay, why not? Has anyone run into this before? Is this really how it works with codeshare flights? Or am I just getting conflicting info?

n2bzwxk,"In terms of upgrading to another class, it‚Äôs complex but generally no, you can‚Äôt upgrade in advance unless the airlines are really tightly integrated.

Likewise, as it‚Äôs a codeshare (flight has a Hainan code) then from Asiana‚Äôs perspective it‚Äôs a Hainan flight and they can‚Äôt access their systems. Someone high up at Asiana likely \*could\* upgrade you, so if you do have high status with them and ask real nicely, maybe. You are likely to be able to upgrade at check in though, check in and gate agents will have much more freedom. In terms of seat position, you can request a seat change at check in for sure, even to an extra legroom seat if they‚Äôre available. You can do this after check in too - gate agent or lounge agent should have no issues doing that.

1lva6r7,"Hi, just wanted to share some good vibes with the good community of solo travellers... The back story is that I bought a ticket to Bangkok Thailand for my visa application. I'm often a last minute mover so I booked the flight two and a half weeks ahead. It wasn't enough time so without a visa a boarded the plane as I booked another flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh (capital of Cambodia). This is not normal at all and I faced questions at every departure. The journey from Capetown to Cambodia was 39 hours... and I was almost denied entry into Cambodia. My country is listed as being able to get a visa upon arrival (it's a little more complicated though). Luckily I had an HSBC bank card on me with my name and was asked to draw $300 ontop of the $700 I had and that morning I had spoken with HSBC online to increase my daily limit to GBP1000... I withdrew the $300 and was given a visa but still had one last desk to go through before being let into the country. The officer at that last desk was grumpy and confused. Wasn't happy to let me in but called his supervisor who nodded and said it was fine. I was in. I checked into a hostel that cost $5 per night in a 6 bed dorm. As far as I can tell, there were 3 others in the room who were very quiet and considerate. The room also had AC which was nice although it got too cold and the bed only came with a sheet as it's usually too warm... I went to the ""Long walk"" at night on Sunday which had 100's of food stalls with all sorts of food... and most meals here are around $2.50... The Cambodian's are amazing at driving. They race up and down and across streets with oncoming traffic and they manage! I don't think they really care too much about what others are doing or how they look. I don't get the feeling that they care much about status unlike other countries that are obsessed with showing how wealthy or cool they are. Extremely respectful and so far, honest. So, if you're in between jobs and have some time, you might like to visit Cambodia. Oh, just remembered, I got an hour long, traditional Khmer massage for $7... incredible!

If you‚Äôve used this or something similar, I‚Äôd love your thoughts.

I think as long as you find one that fits your pup well with saddlebags evenly situated on each side/balanced that's what matters most. For sleeping our girls get into our sleeping bags with us, but if it's hot they're equally comfortable just lying on our sleeping bags. Depending where you are it is probably best to keep your pup in the tent overnight for fear of predators (don't know if you were thinking otherwise). Even still, one of our dogs was so excited by trumpeting elk in Yellowstone that she burst through the screen of the tent and ran off. ü´† Items in your first aid kit specific to dogs (really good wrap for paw injuries, medical tape, extra bandana, syringe for cleaning, charcoal tablets, good pliers and read up on removing quills). And get the really good flea/tick med like bravecto and a lepto vaccine. You didn't ask about vaccines, but lepto is helpful. Other bonus items are e-collar that has gps tracking. E-collar really helps when our dogs get out of sight (they usually stay pretty close though). Our girls only use the beep setting. We don't have the GPS, but there are many times we wish we did. One of our pups has wandered farther and it would have saved us lots of time looking for her.

lzw9kxn,"Baba Nyonya. In a sense it could be said as Chinese people who embraced malay culture. However, if dig deeper , they are more of the people that maintain traditional Chinese culture (even older traditions than what modern Chinese usually having) and has interesting background. Their history start from Ming Emperor sending his people to explore world, went South, found Melaka king, gave him one of the princess as gift of loyalty to China, the princess's people that follow her started their own family in Tanah Melayu, creating mix of Chinese-Malay people. Later they can be found anywhere in South direction of China like in Gajah Putih (Thailand) , India, Sumatera(Indonesia) and etc. The reason they called Baba Nyonya are because they already adapt to life in Tanah Melayu, leading them to be proud of duo culture they maintain, creating a new identity prominent in SEA until the new Chinese came (which is during China Civil War in 1927 evacuated to Southward.)They scorned the new Chinese probably of ideology differences (communism ideal when Baba like democracy) or different culture as post-civil China is undergoing a ""special"" revolution which didn't sit well with the Baba. They don't consider themselves the Chinese or Malay as they already got their proud and unique culture. Then British came, they absorb new knowledge, adept in English and become King's Chinese, become influential in Singapore and Melaka under rule of British, becoming their semi-right hand men. Well they do adapt well, I mean they bringing Buddhism first, embraced Islam during their life there and then embraced the Christian, which make British people like them more. Which Christianity brought by Portugal who come after British. So the British they were surprised ""Christians exist here?"" but delight for sure which then widespread across Malaya. They also play huge role in securing Sultan's power, basically become diplomat and peaceful bridge for both side, British and Malay. Afterward, Japan. This period render entire Baba status they built into dust as Japanese don't care who you are. look like Chinese? you are Chinese, send to the camp. Hell, they don't spare anyone. Healing period came after WW2, Baba is recovering but British decided to do all Chinese look the same. This had the Baba in the butt as everything they did just went to longkang. So Baba try to salvage whatever they can. Rebuild their birthright. However, most of later Baba generation did not do that, probably due to their poverty? Which later come to screw them back. Most people might not notice the fact that Baba Nyonya has the status of Bumiputera, However, due to political reasons and the change in social status in the regions, especially in Malaysia, Baba Nyonya has lost its prestigious status when a policy by the Malaysian Federal Government was introduced that showed all Baba Nyonya are categorized as Chinese. Sad ain't it? Some of Malays could potentially has Chinese blood in them yet they decide to cut off one of their long-term brothers and sisters all so they can have what? Higher status? Purity?

lqf0mz1,"I‚Äôm currently on an indefinite round-the-world bicycle tour, and spent two months this summer bikepacking Mongolia & wanted to share some thoughts and photos. Mongolia is definitely not a place you want to come to unprepared, especially if you want to venture further inland rather than just following the handful of asphalt roads. Only 20% of roads in the country are paved! So get yourself some wide tires and know how to repair your bike - it‚Äôs unlikely to come across a bikestore in the countryside of the least densely populated country in the world üòâ I spent majority of my time in the Altai Mountains in the far west of the country, where most locals are actually ethnically Kazakh. Since Mongolia was never part of the Soviet Union, the Kazakhs here actually managed to preserve their culture better than those in modern-day Kazakhstan. Encounters were always nice, you will be offered plenty of Airag (fermented horse milk) and rock-hard cheese. But the food isn‚Äôt the reason you come to Mongolia, it‚Äôs to experience the way of life of the nomads and to enjoy the nature and remoteness. Those things can be quite challenging at times, not only does it require one to carry food for multiple days, drink water from streams and rivers (bring a good filter!) but it also requires a sturdy tent. I had multiple nights where I had to reinforce my tent wall with my body so it doesn‚Äôt collapse, because of super strong winds. I also experienced a snowstorm in June while crossing one of the 3000m passes. One minor mishap I had was when I got a deep cut in my foot because I slipped during a river crossing - luckily I was close to a village but it‚Äôs better to have a sufficient first aid kit in case you are in the middle of nowhere. There is also little to no cellphone service outside of the settlements, so an SOS beacon could be a wise investment. In the villages you will find a pharmacy and a couple mini-markets, but don‚Äôt always expect restaurants or homestays. These small grocery stores are surprisingly well stocked, in my experience it‚Äôs easier to find what you need here than in big cities in China! After over a month in the Altai Mountains I made it to the next ‚Äúbig‚Äù city to witness the Naadam, Mongolia‚Äôs biggest annual festival. Celebrating their culture with traditional outfits and dances, as well as the ‚ÄúThree Games of Men‚Äù: Horse racing, wrestling and archery (where women also compete). It was a show that I won‚Äôt forget, and you shouldn‚Äôt miss if you visit Mongolia during summer. After skipping a few hundred kilometres of the asphalt road through the Gobi desert by bus I cycled another loop in the Khanghai mountains in the centre of the country, where the nature was similarly beautiful and slightly less rugged. It was a bit greener which meant more nomads, and a lot more livestock - yak, sheep, goats and a couple horses. I then continued my way towards Ulaanbaatar, the capital, where I got my Chinese visa for the next adventure- the Tibetan Plateau (where I am now). Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, unfortunately I can‚Äôt respond to everyone. I will post some pics from other countries I‚Äôve cycled across in the coming days. ü´°",positive,positive,0.9935,positive,0.9982

The arc of scamming has gone from quaint and humorous to mildly frustrating to ulcer inducing rage.

Haggling was always cultural and one can expect that but it‚Äôs morphed into something insidious and ugly. I‚Äôm a seasoned traveller and have survived robberies and gun point, tsunamis, earthquakes and terrorists. Not much phases me but there is no way I will go back to Turkey. I‚Äôm also a Tourism consultant and have seen other destinations devolve into these cesspits but they are usually isolated to a bunch of industry specific bad actors (taxis the usual culprits). Turkey seems to be seeing an ugly osmosis into all facets of tourism. As stated by other commenters these scams are widely reported and most can be avoided (YouTube, blogs etc) but who wants to go to a destination where every waking moment (and even when you are sleeping) you are on guard.

Each day they would come to my bedside with no mask and force me to pay $300 even on my credit card. Couple days in the had me do a CT scan just to be safe or make money off of me. Eventually I got WiFi so I posted on Facebook to find that my old college friend now lives in Istanbul and that I should be getting free treatment or at least $100 a night stay at the Hilton. I put him on speaker phone on whatsapp where he berated them in Turkish to the point where he filed a complaint with the ministry of health and they kicked me out of the hospital. They were supposed to discharge me with ambulance to the Hilton since I was COVID positive but nope. Anyways Google maps showed a 3.5 hour walk since I could take taxi or metro given I was still COVID positive to the Hilton which other than dodging feral dogs wasn't that bad. I paid extra each day for a COVID test with hopes of negative sooner. Day 9 I was negative but the test had a big watermark saying I was forbidden to leave the country. Later on I come to find out that they won't let you leave until 14 days and two negative tests. After day 14 I got another negative and got the F on the next flight home.

The whole ""pay max price first get reimbursed later"" flexible tariff system for Marmaray is a big lie, because to receive a refund you need to have a personalised Istanbulkard which only residents can get.

I've been here before but not them so she thought it'd Also be nice for me to guide them around for a bit. My cousin is the pickiest eater I have ever had the displeasure of travelling with. Such a royal pain in the butt. For her, even jokbal (pork trotters) is too ""exotic and weird"". We passed by a dakgalbi restaurant and she also refused because she's worried it'll be spicy (it's literally not...). We had a delicious kbbq dinner but she only ate plain meat and rice because she refused to eat any of the free side dishes. She sulked the whole dinner and we had to go to Subway after that. What about Korean fried chicken? Who doesn't like that?? HER. The most irritating and audacious thing happened today. We went to a Korean Chinese restaurant and I ordered my favourite jajangmyeon, my aunt ordered jjampong and cousin ordered... dumplings. Yay. Something she's willing to eat. When my jajangmyeon came, she looked at it with disgust and let out a silent ""Eww"". And at some point even said something along the lines of ""that looks disgusting"" ""you really like that?"" ...I was really annoyed and pissed at that point but I didn't want to get angry on vacation so I just said ""Yeah it actually tastes better than it looks, want some?"" She shook her head and didn't say anything else. I just found her comments so stupid and uncalled for because I spent some time on the map app searching for restaurants that has food her stupid palate can handle. Anyways we're fortunately parting ways tomorrow as I am moving to Suwon and then Busan so I can't wait to enjoy the rest of my trip eating all my favourite Korean food and she can eat all the sandwiches she want.

Hamn√∏y Pic 7-8: Village of √Ö Pic 9-10: Nusfjord Pic 11-12: Loftr Viking Museum Pic 13: Svolv√¶r Pic 14: Tjeldbergtind view of Svolv√¶r Pic 15: Henningsv√¶r Pic 16: Verdenssvaet hike, near Narvik We spent nine days in the area. Most of the stunning scenic areas start around Svolv√¶r and progressively become more impressive as you go west towards the village of √Ö at the far southwestern end of the archipelago, with about 2.5 hours driving distance between them. Some quick suggestions: 1. Getting there: Most will first fly into Oslo and then take a flight up to one of many regional airports such as Evenes (EVE, for rental car), Troms√∏ (TOS, for rental car), Bod√∏ (BOO, for ferry), or even directly to Svolvaer (SVJ) or Leknes (LKN) on smaller airplanes with more limited / seasonal schedules. 2. Good bases to stay in would be Reine / Hamn√∏y area, Leknes / Ballstad area, and Henningsv√¶r/Kabelv√•g area. These areas are central to many scenic spots and highlights. If you have the time, I would allocate 2-3 nights to each area so you can minimize driving time and explore each area in depth. 3. Weather can be quite variable. We were there in late August and had many days of rain / cloud, but we still got to do hikes and outdoor activities every day as the rain would stop and the sun came out. Be prepared with good hiking shoes, ponchos/umbrellas and a flexible, open attitude! 4. Costs: The most expensive prices are for rental cars at $125-150 per day (likely cheaper outside of peak summer season). Gas was NOK 20-25/liter (approx. US$7.50-9.00 per gallon). Restaurant entrees are US$35-45 at upscale places and $20-30 at moderate places (no additional tax / tip beyond menu prices). There are decent groceries in larger towns such as Leknes and Svolvaer where food prices are moderate and many rorbu hotels have kitchens or kitchenette. Hotel costs are in line with popular international tourist destinations at $250-500+ per night. 5. Things to do: Stunning scenery everywhere you look. Nature lover and photographers‚Äô dream. The two lane highway E10 that links the islands must be one of the most scenic drives in the world. Outdoor activities‚Äî Hiking, with very high payoff vs effort ratio. Kayaking, fjord cruises, boating, and surfing / beach in good summer weather. Culture and history, where you can learn about Lofoten fishermen way of life, colorful rorbu cabins, stockfish production and salmon farming, and even the Vikings (the museum is on the site of the largest Viking longhouse ever found) Just an amazing, unique place in the world.",positive,positive,0.9882,positive,0.9994

lyi54y3,"I‚Äôm currently cycling around the world and this past winter I spent two months cycling in Oman üá¥üá≤, a.k.a. the hidden gem of the Middle East, a country which surprised me with its natural diversity, laidback way of life & hospitality. I wanted to share some pics & thoughts. As soon as entered Oman from the UAE, I took a turn onto a small road heading into the Hajar Mountains. I was rewarded with a rugged but beautiful mountainous landscape, and butter-smooth yet empty roads. This part of the country is sparsely populated, and you will come across many more goats than humans. Despite this there are frequent drinking water dispensers on the side of the road, often even cooled! If you are looking for a challenge, search for unpaved roads or paths on your maps, as these usually lead through Wadis, which are dry river beds, resulting in short, but unimaginably steep ascents, often reaching inclines of 30%. This meant a lot of bike-pushing, which even in winter is exhausting as temperatures were still hovering around 30C. Villages are sparse but very scenic, and also felt quite conservative, often the only people speaking English were migrants, mostly from Pakistan or Bangladesh. One afternoon a Pakistani family invited me for dinner and to spend at their place, and even offered to slaughter a goat for me, which I declined. As I continued my way south and left the steep Wadi roads behind, I came across the first foreign tourists, most of them visiting the historic cities of Al Hamra and Nizwa, famous for its forts and date plantations. Here you will also find the Jebel Shams, with just over 3000m the highest mountain on the Arabian peninsula. I took a short break to rest and to do some hiking. I then made my way towards the capital of Oman, Muscat, mainly to replace my broken camping stove. Apparently there are some nice beaches around Muscat, but I only spent a day here as I cycling in cities designed for cars will never be fun to cycle in (looking at you, Dubai!). However, Muscat marked the starting point for the long journey towards Salalah, Oman‚Äôs third biggest city, and the only major one in the south, close to Yemen. The distance via the highway is about 1000km, however it crosses Oman in the centre, which is mostly a massive wasteland, with few resupply points. Instead I wanted to cycle ~1300km along the coast, where I would pass through some small cities and fishing villages, and the landscape would be a bit more interesting. Or so I thought. Shortly after I reached the North-Eastern tip of Oman and started heading south, the landscape became extremely monotonous. Most of the time the road was actually a few kilometres inland, so I couldn‚Äôt quickly hop into the ocean to cool down or relax at the beach. I was surrounded by a empty, flat land with nothing more than a few bushes and the occasional camel for the next two weeks. That was longer than planned for this stretch, reason being that during the first week I was facing strong headwinds making the ride even more challenging, physically and mentally. Fortunately two fellow German bicycle travellers were also in the region, so we met up and made the boring ride a bit more entertaining. After a few days together we parted ways and I slowly started to appreciate the solitude, reason being the lack of cars, silence, clear night skies and the fact that the headwind was gone. I started making process and soon reached the mountains of the Dhofar governorate, of which Salalah is the capital. A spectacular scenery can be found in this region, with pristine beaches on the left, steep mountains on the right, and scenic Wadis in between. In summer it is supposedly even more picturesque, when the entire landscape is green and full of life thanks to tropical storms (‚ÄòKhareef‚Äô) bringing in lots of rain. Temperatures will also drop below 30C, making it arguably the only place in Oman where one could cycle during summer, when temperatures in rest of the region reach 40+ degrees Celsius. And just like that I had made it - cycling almost the entire length of Oman. Continuing further south into Yemen wouldn‚Äôt have been wise, so I flew to Kyrgyzstan to continue my journey around the globe. Looking back, Oman is definitely among my favourite countries I‚Äôve been to. You will be surprised by its diverse landscape and warmly welcomed by the Omanis and migrant workers alike. Cities are modern, there are many cheap restaurants and free drinking water can be found at mosques. It‚Äôs also one of the safest countries in the world, making it an option for solo female travellers. On that note, I was surprised how few local women I‚Äôve come across during my two months here. Oman is quite a bit more conservative than the Emirates for example in that regard. On the flip side, this means that you will find beautiful traditional architecture instead of skyscrapers.

The city had such a laid back feel and we were dreaming about what it would be like to live here. It seemed so much less stressful than what we're used to. People stayed up late, ate great food and met friends. It was beautiful. After that we drove to the Algarve (pics 9-18) by car where we stayed nine nights mostly for the beaches. We really wanted to find a beach which wasn't too crowded and just relax in the sun. This was not as easy as we thought, but we still found one.

1f48sg1,"I spent a few months traveling in Africa with my boyfriend, and Namibia was the third country we visited. We were there from April 26th - May 7th. I love the desert so Namibia was incredible! The weather was hot but dry, low to high 90's usually. We did most activities early in the morning or late afternoon, too hot between 1-4pm to really do anything. We opted to rent our own car and self-drive, it was easy to do and definitely one of the easier African countries to take this approach. It gave us a lot of freedom to spend our time how we wanted (vs with tours), and especially during safari we could pick and could spend as much time as we wanted with our favorite animals (lions are kinda boring, give me more wildebeest! The drama). We never felt unsafe at any point on the trip. We spent 2 camping nights in Sossuvlei National Park, 2 nights in Swakupmund, 2 nights in Damaraland, and 3 nights doing self-drive safari in Etosha National Park. Each end was capped with a night in Windhoek. It was jam packed and all of it was great for different reasons! Didn't have a fancy camera with so a lot of the safari pics aren't as fancy as other peoples. Highlights included: - Enjoying desert sunsets at our campground in Sossuvlei. - Deadvlei was what inspired the trip, and it was as awesome as I had hoped. Crowds were not a problem for us. - Spent a half day doing looking for Welwitschia plants out by Swakupmund, extremely rare and can be up to 1500 years old. They're much bigger than I was expecting! - Desert elephant tracking in Damaraland. Saw a group of 14 elephants plus 3 bulls. - Seeing a cheetah hunt in Etosha after being in the park for 5 min (didn't get the catch) - Watching rhino drama at the watering holes in Etosha every night. They're so grumpy and dramatic, its like Real Housewives of Namibia. At one point we could count 15, Etosha is def the place to go to see them. We did safari in five other countries and only saw one rhino (Kruger).",positive,positive,0.9921,positive,0.9925

There was a woman sitting across the aisle from us with a little girl who was flying as a lap child. Dad was sitting right next to mom and baby. Dad ignored both of them and even snapped at them a few times. The flight attendant kept scolding mom because the child wanted to be on the floor. Dad did nothing but play on his I phone the entire flight. The child was wiggly, fussy, and bored, and I've never seen a mom look so stressed out and tired. Even though she spoke no English. I managed to communicate that I'd be happy to play with the baby so poor mom could get some dang rest. That baby eventually crawled into my husbands lap and slept on his shoulder for 8 hours, and if I had to guess, that was the first 8 full hours of sleep mom had in years. And that darling child seemed to really love being cuddled by a dad type, even if it wasn't her dad. I wanted to smack her husband. He was absolutely useless. When mom woke up, she seemed scared to see her kid sleeping on a dude (who was also dead asleep haha), I got the sense that she was not afraid for her kid, but that she was afraid my husband would yell at her. I just motioned for her to use the restroom and get something to eat, that the baby and my husband were just fine.

1fp3qv1,"I'm a 24M, I've spent the last five years entirely focused on building my career. I‚Äôve made solid progress, but along the way, I realized I was feeling lonely and unfulfilled. No meaningful relationships, no adventures, no new experiences. Just work. Then, in a moment of clarity, I did something impulsive. I booked a trip to Italy, planned the whole thing in one night, and stopped making excuses. Time was slipping by, and while saving money and focusing on my career got me far, I wasn't going to get my 20s back. I couldn't stand the idea of not feeling alive. The world is too amazing to just hide at home. So, I got on that flight with almost no expectations, ready to explore Rome and try solo travel. Little did I know, this trip would completely change how I see the world. At the hostel, I quickly met some incredible people. Soon, I found myself canceling my pre-planned activities to hang out with them, and it was the best decision ever. I learned that good people can turn even a simple trip into something unforgettable. I'm so glad I approached them. I'm usually too self-conscious and wait for others to approach me, which is not the best strategy... One of the best parts of traveling alone was the chance to reinvent myself. Nobody knew my past or my habits, which gave me the freedom to be a better version of myself. Being away from home let me finally grow into the person I wanted to be. I saw this girl in the common room and felt drawn to her but didn't think much of it. Later, we accidentally bumped into each other while going out for a drink, and she bought me one. We spent the whole evening together and even exchanged necklaces before returning to our rooms. The next day, we had a magical date, like a scene from Before Sunrise, and parted ways as she returned to her country. That connection made the trip unforgettable and made me think about how meaningful it is to share moments with someone. It made me think about how important it is for me to find my wife and build a life with her. I realized I'd burned out trying to be hyper-focused on success, thinking I was smarter than my peers. But we all need real experiences and connections to feel alive. This trip woke me up. I used to make excuses, like ‚Äútravel is overrated‚Äù or ""I'll enjoy it later,"" but there's no perfect moment. Now, I'm planning a 3-6 month trip to Asia. With no major responsibilities and a flexible schedule, I have little to lose and so much to gain. I want to feel alive again, and I'm tired of playing it safe, thinking I can just save it all for ""later."" Traveling has made me more social and opened my eyes to how big the world truly is. I can choose where to live and what kind of life to build. The perfectionist in me still wants to hold back, but that's not living. Life happens while we're busy planning for a perfect future. I used to fear challenges and discomfort. Now, my biggest fear is living a safe, easy life in my hometown. It's crazy how one trip can change your perspective so much. If you're thinking about going on a trip, but aren't quite sure, just go for it. This is your sign. If you can't, do everything you can to find a way to do it. Remember, on your deathbed you'll mostly regret the things you didn't do. **TL;DR:** After years of prioritizing my career, I took a spontaneous trip to Italy and discovered I'd been missing out on truly living. I made new friends, met someone special, and gained a fresh perspective on life. Success and money mean little if you don‚Äôt experience the world and create memories. If you‚Äôre hesitant to travel, just go for it. You won‚Äôt regret it. You‚Äôll return home a better person.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

low6kjk,"When I retired five years ago I had three main goals: travel often, become a better volleyball official and try to live life to the fullest. After being retired for almost 4 years and looking back at my life since retirement I saw that I was very happy officiating volleyball almost 12 months out of the year but the only travel I was doing was across the country working various volleyball tournaments. With the help of a good friend, I realized that I kept putting off recreational traveling primarily because I was very hesitant to travel alone. It was at that time that I decided to make the time in my busy volleyball schedule and just give solo traveling a try. I planned a 2 week trip to ƒ∞stanbul for April 2023. About 5 days before my scheduled trip, my AirBnB host informed me they had COVID and I needed to find a new AirBnB ASAP, which I was able to do. Long story short, I am now happily married to my AirBnB host and live half the year in ƒ∞stanbul! It is funny how much life can change on a dime!

1hbbhks,"Before I get into it, yes, I acknowledge I need therapy lol. Everyone says they prefer solo travel because they run on their own schedule, don‚Äôt have to accommodate anyone else‚Äôs needs, etc. My real, honest answer is that I want to feel like I‚Äôm doing something right for once in my life. I feel like such a fuck up in everyday life when it comes to work, friendships (major social anxiety), school, etc. Travelling solo gives me the opportunity to prove to myself I *can* do something right for a change. Being able to throw myself into a foreign country and figuring things out on my own makes me think that maybe I‚Äôm not *completely* incompetent. Any hiccups along the way can be kept to myself instead of managers being CC‚Äôd on emails or people thinking I‚Äôm weird/stupid.

Basically, it all boils down to exposure therapy and he told me to have more experiences in life by challenging myself. And challenging myself I did (I have another story to tell where I went out with an older woman than me, something that was a mental block in my life, as I've always been told to go out with women younger than me). So I am in Osaka right now, contemplating going to a bar alone. This thought was daunting, but I felt I needed to do this. Initially, I chickened out and bought a drink from a supermarket to have in my hotel room. When I got back and drank half of the bottle while playing music, I realized how lame that was. Why not have the experience I wanted at a bar in freaking Japan? Summoning all my courage, I took a shower, dressed up myself and walked outside. I walked around in Osaka, saw several bars on Google maps, but did not have the courage to walk in. I decided to head back to my hotel. But then I decided to just walk into a bar. I checked out the bar and decided the vibe wasn't right. I checked out another bar a few streets down the line (on a fifth floor/speakeasy vibe) and it was empty. There was another group of people but they were in a separate room hence we didn't have interaction. I decided to go in. I just wanted to say that this was excellent exposure therapy. I sat at the bar counter by myself. I was just being myself, played a bit on my phone / responded to some messages, chatted with the bartender who was very friendly with broken English, and enjoyed some jazz music and amazing cocktail. I had a great time and it was a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I am also very proud of myself.

1ecitwh,I‚Äôm travelling alone and staying in an all female dorm in Brussels. I specifically booked a female only dorm because I did not want to be around random men. One of the girls brought a random guy into the room last night and proceeded to have sex with him. I made it very clear that I could hear them but they continued. He then left in the morning. Seriously wtf goes through people‚Äôs minds to think that bringing a random man into a female only dorm AND having sex with him while other girls are sleeping is okay?! Go get a hotel room if you‚Äôre that horny. It‚Äôs gross and inconsiderate. I went and complained to the reception staff who thankfully allowed me to change rooms.

l3g8aix,"It seems things don't change. My friend and I (at the time, both early 20s females) were backpacking across Europe on a shoestring budget about 25 years ago. Immediately upon our arrival in Italy, we got surrounded by a pack of random men in the train station and didn't feel safe (initially we were just concerned about them being a gang of pickpockets, but as they kept increasing in number and tightening the circle, we became extremely uncomfortable). We ignored them as much as possible and talked to each other, loudly mentioning the police a few times before they finally dispersed enough we finally could walk away. The next day we again encountered aggressively weird men so we noped out Italy, heading to Austria, which wasn't previously on our itinerary at all. Beautiful country and we felt much safer and at ease. Things can change a lot in 25 years of course, but I wouldn't hesitate to return to Austria and would actively avoid returning to Italy at this point. Were they dangerous? Probably not, since they eventually let us leave. But it definitely soured our opinion of the country as a whole --we never made it to Rome, which we had been looking forward to.

1es9bg4,"Budget: $3K + flights. I‚Äôm not great at tracking my budget. So this is a five months later estimate.

I mapped out the areas I wanted to visit for sure ‚Äî Harajuku, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Yoyogi park. Each day I took the train to a different area and just wondered around. This is the way to do Tokyo. I loved allowing myself to be surprised by the city. A highlight was the biggest cosmetics store (Cosme Harajuku) in Tokyo. I purchased so many skincare products. Five months later and I‚Äôm still using my products. When researching this trip, I saw a lot of Tsukiji Fish market haters. However I loved it! I went at like 5:30 AM (thanks jet lag). I ate a bleeding fresh bowl of tuna. It was topped with uni ‚Äî first time trying it! The uni added a buttery smooth texture to this delicious rice bowl. I also sampled the strawberry daifuku. I don‚Äôt fuck with mochi like that, but it was tasty. That strawberry was the star of course. Miss Strawberry is an icon! I‚Äôm a relaxation girlie. And there are two quintessential relaxation experiences in Japan ‚Äî the headspa and the onsen. First the headspa. I‚Äôm a Black woman with natural Afro texture hair. I was nervous that the experience would be negative because they surely don‚Äôt get many clients like me. However, my masseuse was amazing. She had a translator device that we used to communicate. She asked me about how to treat my hair. I told her not to brush or blow dry it. She then gave me the best scalp massage of my life, and my hair was so soft after. Honestly shocked the products worked ok on me, but I suppose a good product is a good product. Since I didn‚Äôt need a blow dry, she used the extra time to give me a foot massage. In total, the treatment was 3 hours and a total highlight of my experience. The Hakone onsen was also fabulous. I booked a ryokan with a private outdoor onsen. I took at least four dips every day. I needed this chill few days after the chaos of Tokyo. While you‚Äôre in Hakone, I recommend the Open Air museum. It‚Äôs a sculpture museum nestled amongst the mountains. The space put me in a contemplative mood ‚Äî very Japanese, I know. I spent a few hours just wondering the space and appreciating the care they put into its curation. I‚Äôm not going to talk too much about Kyoto because this was the work portion of my trip. But I will say, I found getting up at 5 AM for the bamboo forest to be worth it. There was no one there, except me, the monks who care for the area, and a few joggers. If you do visit, please respect the forest. I saw lots of initials carved into these gorgeous bamboo trees. That made me sad, because the monks allow us to visit this beautiful space. We should leave it how we found it. My other Kyoto recommendation is to walk the Philosophers Path. It was quiet and peaceful. And at the end of the path, I found a lone cherry blossom tree that had bloomed! Feels like a metaphor for my trip. One thing I missed out on was nightlife. I heard that Tokyo has amazing nightlife. I was not feeling very social, but I with I would have joined a bar crawl. Final Verdict: I loved Japan. I was there as a kid and have overwhelming memories of Japanese people touching me and taking my photo, as the only Black person around at the time. That was over two decades ago, and things have changed a lot. I felt welcomed in all the spaces I went to ‚Äî even Hakone, where I was basically the only Black person and one of maybe five westerners. About Me: I am a 31 year old Black American queer woman. I am fairly experienced with solo travel, and am comfortable navigating new spaces. I also tend towards a high budget trip, as I value paying for comfortable and safe accommodations, as well as unique experiences.",positive,positive,0.9906,positive,0.9994

1fe7byx,"I‚Äôm 22y Female, I came to Venice, Italy yesterday night and today is my second day in this hostel. This morning I had to reception to ask for the towel, and he gave me a towel and asked me where am I from. I said I‚Äôm Korean and he said he thought I was Chinese, and I look really sexy. I felt uncomfortable from that moment, but I didn‚Äôt want to make a scene so I just say thank you and left. I head to the lounge and worked on my laptop, and that receptionist came to put the bed sheets down to the lounge. He says that he loves me, and ask me if I love him too. I really don‚Äôt get why this person asks this so randomly to me so I just said I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. He keeps asked me if I love him and I said I have a boyfriend. He said my face looks good and asked me if I want to have s3x with him. Of course I don‚Äôt want so I strongly said no several times, and he keeps telling me he has another private room in this building and ask for having s3x with him. I neglected several time and he left after that. I didn‚Äôt tell this to the manager of this facility but I already feel so frustrated since it‚Äôs not even the other guest but the staff of this facility that I‚Äôm gonna stay for few nights. I talked with my boyfriend about this but still I‚Äôm scared of what‚Äôs going to happen, or how the owner would react. I'm afraid of retaliation. I‚Äôm going to tell this to the manager of this facility and the website that I used for making a reservation. I feel afraid about making a scene, please anyone give me advice about this situation. ________ Edited:! 14.Sep.2024 Hello, guys. Final update. Thanks for concerning and cheering for the last time. It really encouraged me a lot and helpful practically and mentally as well ü•π First, I tried to contact through booking.com, I asked for the number of owner, I contacted with that number. I asked if he‚Äôs the owner of the facility because I wanted to make sure if I‚Äôm secured and safe to talk to him about this. He said he is not (which is someone gave me a different number, not the actual number of the owner) and refused to give me the actual number of the owner. And he told me to come to the hostel in the morning to meet him. Which I thought was quite a ridiculous thing to say. After that, I saw someone left a review at google map after I post this, and the owner replied to that review to contact her. I contacted her, and she asked me about the situation and appearance of him. I told her every detail of situation and his appearance, name, etc. She sincerely apologized to me and promised me this kind of incident is never should have been happened and never going to happen anymore in that facility. She showed me a deep empathy toward this situation. And showed me thank for reaching out and report. And I got promised for the refund for whole stay. I didn‚Äôt reach out for the police since I didn‚Äôt have enough time in Italy but still think wish I would for the further incident that can be happened. So‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how it all figured out. I will not able to do this all things without your all encouragement. I‚Äôm happy that I was able to report this situation and speak up. I also want to encourage all the people to not just tolerate sexual harassment and speak up for other women. Even though I felt so frustrated to report, explain, writing review, concerning about retribution but I‚Äôm sure that it was really important and worth to speak up. I wouldn‚Äôt put any more words about that facility since I wouldn‚Äôt know how my words are going to affect. Thanks again for sharing your opinion and numerous encouragement. I sincerely hope you all be happy, peace, and safe. I‚Äôll always wish you all the luck : )",positive,positive,0.9744,positive,0.9998

For context, I travelled around lots of Europe for almost 3 months and returned back to my home in Canada two months ago. Most of the trip was great, some ups and downs, I wasn't feeling all the best all the time but for the majority of it I was having a blast. I think being solo for almost all of it made me confront a lot of my inner thoughts and feelings, so trying to navigate that while changing my setting a lot caused a rollercoaster of emotions. But beyond the typical wonder of travel and exploring, I ended up having a short romance with someone on my trip (a local) and I didn't want to leave. This was near the end of my trip, so I already had my plane ticket home and things booked, plus the expiration date on my visa. But in a perfect world void of any commitments or responsibilities, I would have stayed to see how things developed. Granted, this was only a week long romance and I understand that I was in exceptional circumstances while travelling with the whole rose-coloured glasses and what not. But I haven't been able to shake my experience with this person and it has been over two months since I left their city. Being home now, I'm feeling like my life is so dull. This big trip was supposed to be something I did after I graduated university to get a bit of travel under my belt before starting a career full time. Now that I'm starting my career I just feel dread that I'm starting to work towards a life here while I feel a pull to head back Europe to live at least for a bit. I think the fact that I travelled solo for such a long time altered my brain a bit. Like if the trip was shorter, I could feel like it was a vacation, but the way that I extended it so long made me develop feelings of staying. Even if this person moves on, it's the fact that I felt like I found a place for me to flourish and be myself overseas which is something I lack at home. I had planned to wait things out and allow myself to move on but for months now I've just been in a weird state of mind where I feel sad and directionless and want to take steps towards an internship or something overseas to live there even for a little bit.

It didn't go away for me - opposite of a 'vacation' where you're supposed to come out of it feeling recharged to keep life at home going. This culminated into me eventually selling my things, quitting my job and pivoting into a new life where I'm able to chase my curiosities (my 'northstars'), even if the path to get to them isn't 100% clear.

lrhqf7o,"Having had a very similar experience, I have some good insights for you. This was over a year ago. Solo traveled Europe for 3 months. About half way through the trip, I met a girl who was also traveling. We hit it off, and ended up traveling a bit together for like a week. In that brief time, I felt the most love and connection I‚Äôve ever felt for anyone. When this was happening, she was at the end of her trip and had to return home (on the other side of the world from where I lived). She seemed to accept what I didn‚Äôt want to: it was never going to work. And she was right. You simply cannot and should not move to the other side of the world to be with someone you just met. When she left, I felt the emptiest I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. I was so heartbroken. If she randomly popped into my mind, my heart would hurt so badly that it was like having the wind suddenly knocked out of me, and I‚Äôd need to literally sit down. That lasted for about 6-7 months after returning home. I‚Äôve since moved on. I think about her now and then but it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much. Im even in a long term relationship now and still don‚Äôt feel the same way with my current partner like the way I felt with her in that one week. Sounds messed up, I know. But here‚Äôs why we feel this way: In the context of travel, especially solo travel, we tend to romanticize things. You meet strangers in hostels who end up feeling like your closest friends for just two days only for you to never see them again, maybe keep in touch on instagram. Everything you see and do is new and exciting and thought provoking and meaningful. The places you go and the people you meet. The same thing can happen on a romantic level. And what easier thing to romanticize than a LITERAL ROMANCE? Lol. It‚Äôs just the state of your brain fueled by the context and side effects of solo adventure. The thing you need to realize is this: You aren‚Äôt actually in love with them. You‚Äôre in love with the idea of them. Also, another solo traveler told me this when i was pouring my heart out about her. He said that he considered me lucky, as most people go through their entire lives without an experience like that. It hurts now, but life gave you something beautiful, albeit brief, and that‚Äôs something to be grateful for. Maybe this will all help a little bit, as it did for me. But still, I feel for ya, because it all hurts just the same!",positive,positive,0.9628,positive,0.9983

It was magical in the beginning, but once we started living together and seeing how we had different life priorities and values, things went quickly down hill.

Amazing family. Anyhow her + I sat on my bed connecting + even tho there was a language barrier I felt deeply connected. I didn't have a loving, attuned grandmother figure growing up + she was the quintessential grandmother. üò≠ So during that sit-down I cried profusely to her + her hugging me genuinely, sharing with her how scared I was returning to Toronto, Canada as I'm scared my souls internal flame will become somewhat of a flicker + I def feel that.

That summer, she told me she was going on a Europe trip so I wanted to meet her somewhere & I planned a road trip for us in Sardinia, Italy - it was magical & this is really where we fell for each other.

Been living together since January this year & every day has been amazing & we‚Äôre now building a life together here.

I'm also a black woman and I'm also not American. I have visited countries on every continents except Antartica. I have travelled with white schoolmates, I have traveled with friends, with family, with diverse groups and solo. I have encountered intolerance and ignorance from locals at time, but the worse racism is often from other tourists. Whether it's casual racism from ignorance to straight up racism. When you travel with friends or family, it's easier to get ""over it"" because you have someone to debrief the situation. When you travel alone it's something else because you don't have a support system and you live those experiences alone and have to cope. It kind of ruin the experience... The racism is not necessarily toward me, as I have heard in the past, ""because I'm not like other black people"" but it's toward the staff, locals or anybody working in the tourism industry. It's the always thinking everyone is trying to scam, everyone is trying to steal from you and it's the blatant disregard for local customs and downgrading other ways of life. The racism might not be directed to me but it's directed to people who like me. We hear the racist jokes and the remarks that are on the border of racism. And when you solo travels, well it sucks and prevents you from creating relationships and befriending people, in other words, it excludes you. I loved solo traveling, it was such an amazing experience and I am so grateful to have live this experience. Especially visiting many countries, meeting so many people and traveling for multiple weeks.

As a POC I acknowledge racism is less overt these days but it still can be; it can also be subtle microagressions which many ""travelers"" demonstrate. Thank you for sharing your experience as a POC traveler. We are caught in a world that grants us privilege but we are always mindful of the struggles that out sisters and brothers experience. I always find a connection with them; I'm an immigrant from the Third World. They know I've faced what they've faced.",positive,positive,0.8123,positive,0.9994

lq9m7z9,"I am not American nor white. The only times I've encountered racism towards black people were while traveling, when racist comments were made only by other travelers. It's always left me baffled. But come to think of it, many people, while travel, let loose of social norms and allow themselves to do things they wouldn't normally do back home. The first thing that comes to mind in this context is the concept of nudist beaches in developing countries - that many times are defined as ""nudist"" only by tourists and under protest from local communities. The same way a traveler would not just declare a nearby beach around his/her home as a nudist beach and run to the water naked in front of families and children, they would also not make any unacceptable racist comments at home. Abroad while traveling, however, no one knows us, our actions (within legal boundaries of course) don't affect us long term, we are not judged by our communities, we are free from any sociatel expectations or norms, and we all can be whoever we want and do whatever we like. Unfortunately, for some people, this means a green light to make racist comments or tell racist ""jokes"" while travel. But once they're back home and back into their communities, they can not bear the thought that they might not be the good people that they think they are and present themselves as. It's a real cognitive dissonance. And this is where, in my opinion, the gaslighting starts. Racism is real and common while traveling. Don't let anyone gaslight you into believing you're imagining it. It's important to speak up on such matters, to bring awareness, and to remind us that we all can treat each other with more kindness.",negative,negative,0.8853,negative,0.6632

The airport nearly broke me with the indifference and downright rudeness yet also harassment of the staff at every turn (trying to track down missing luggage). After that 3-hour ordeal, I calmed down, ordered an Uber, and planned to meet my guide. I‚Äôd been harassed constantly inside the airport ‚Äútaxi? Taxi, lady? Lady, want taxi? Good price taxi!‚Äù but what I faced outside was exponentially worse. Even though I had an Uber ride booked, dozens of men kept yelling at me and when they saw me going for the rideshare lot, they kept sticking their phones in my face with an Uber map open saying ‚ÄúI am Uber!‚Äù and trying to grab my luggage while blocking my path. Eventually, I became surrounded. I‚Äôve never been in fear for my physical safety like that. Meanwhile, my actual driver was texting me to ask me to pay more money than the fare in the app. I told him no so he canceled the ride. I saw police lights in the parking lot so I headed for them. I tried to order another Uber as I pushed my luggage and tried to fend off a dozen aggressive drivers who were all talking at the same time and trying to block me. That Uber driver texted me that he was already at the lot so I asked him to please pick me up by the blue flashing lights. He canceled the ride. That was my limit for chaos and aggression. I headed for the airport doors. They were guarded and they didn‚Äôt want to let me inside but I kept pushing so they eventually did let me enter.

Remote villages might have one tiendita and one comedor, otherwise you‚Äôd be lucky to pass through any given town on the same day as the vegetable truck. Atop each mountain waited torrential blizzards of horizontal snow and hail, with shards of ice collecting on my tent by morning. Just beyond Oyon I reached the new highest pass of my life: +16,300ft [4,968m]. Locals here blockaded the road in protest against mining activity, so the peak had been subsequently abandoned. I‚Äôd prepared for the cold weather, but even after months across the Andes these extreme elevations devoured my strength. It took everything I had to haul my bike over the makeshift stone walls and continue down the other side. Daylight cratered fast as I raced downhill each afternoon, but the colors up top were what struck me the most.

1ho3ojz,"I live in western NC, so it doesn‚Äôt get ADK level cold but still not uncommon for lows on the higher peaks to get into the teens at night during the winter, the valleys are just as cold. I slept next to a river recently, low of 26 degrees and I was cold as hell. I thought my gear was well equipped, but I still had cold spots in my bag and didn‚Äôt sleep well at all. What am I doing wrong? I use a double walled REI UL tent. Magma 15 down bag Thermarest NeoAir pad (r value of 4?) I slept with merino leggings on, socks and a base layer. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be okay?

m46je7k,"North Carolinian & fellow backpacker here. Your tent is fine but your sleep system does need upgrading for NC high country mtns in the winter. Unfortunately as sweet as that REI Magma is the comfort rating is ~25-30 degrees & the survival rating is 15 degrees. Majority of gender specific bags are rated different. Numbers listed for men are survival numbers where women‚Äôs bags are listed as comfort rating, being more true to the number listed. Your sleeping pad would be fine for the majority of the seasons but temps that low you may wanna look at a pad with at least an R-value of 5. I currently use the Mountain Hardwear Bishop Pass 0-degree down bag but its true rating is only 15 degree for comfort. I‚Äôve recently ordered the women‚Äôs version of the same bag but in a long bc I wanted a true 0-degree bag plus this is a great budget & performance down bag. Though women‚Äôs bags will run a little heavier they also offer more down fill being truer to those temp ratings. Currently REI has several bags, & the Bishop Pass, on the ReSupply section of the website.",positive,positive,0.952,positive,0.9972

m46opfq,"The river is a huge problem. This is because the real feel temp was probably 10 degrees colder than the listed temp. Just like humidity gives you a heat index temp much higher than the actual temp, it also gives you cold temps that are much colder than the actual temps. Comfort rating =/= survival rating on a bag. REI's rating of 15F is neither a comfort rating nor a survival rating. Your bag is comfort rated down to 21F. It's survival rated down to 9F. Survival rating means exactly what it sounds like - you will survive but you will be miserable. It will be too cold to sleep comfortably for most people. Your bag is at it's comfort limit in these conditions BEFORE the relative humidity/real feel temp problem of being near the river. I use Weather Underground for trip planning because they clearly map out both actual and real feel temps. If you have CalTopo, they also have a Lowest Temp in the last 24 hours map. I use this to figure out where to avoid camping. So, how to avoid this? 1. Go read Andrew Skurka's article about picking a site. Better site selection will really help. And will cost you $0 and add 0 lbs to your pack. 2. Know the real feel temps for overnight and plan accordingly. Also, know which side of the topography you are on. Over Thanksgiving, I was backpacking in Arkansas. There was about a 10F difference between the north-facing / north-exposed stream valleys and a more protected south-facing / south -exposed creek valley. This is where temp layers like CalTopo has can help you visualize how temps are interacting with terrain. 3. Understand your gear. Your bag is comfort-rated only to a real feel of 21 degrees. 4. Understand yourself. If this is the first time you have been so cold, you might not be a cold sleeper. I am a cold sleeper. I can only take my bag down to 5F above its comfort rating. Period. I can wear all of my layers including my down coat, down booties and merino wool hat. I still will not be warm enough to sleep if it is too close to the comfort rating on my bag. You can only figure this out by continuing to experiment with colder conditions. One thing I find helpful is to plan less miles per day in colder conditions. If I plan routes that allow me to get all my miles done between 11 am and 5 or 6 pm, I can safely get the sleep I need. I do this because I know that if I am close to my personal bag limit, I won't sleep well until temps warm up after 5 am. If I can get 5 hours of sleep that really helps. But that does mean I won't hit the trail at 7 or 8 am like usual. 5. Wear every layer to bed, including your rain gear. Ponchos and rain coats can act as a vapor proof layer aka VPL. This can help trap heat near your body, not allowing it to escape. Also figure out how to sleep on your pack. Lots of folks put them under their pads, under their feet. I like mine under my head and shoulders as a side sleepr. Again, you are using everything you have as insulation. 6. Adding another pad below your pad will help. The NeoAir has an R value of 4.5. Adding CCF pad below it like the Z lite with an R value of 2.0 will bring your total R value up to 6.5. A modular system like this probably makes the most sense in your case because you only have to bring the extra bulk and weight in specific cases. Try these tricks first. You are looking at $50-$60 and about a pound to your packed weight. For your dog, you might consider packing them a sweater or insulated jacket for them to wear at night on these cold trips. I am also a huge fan of how much mylar emergency blankets help with very little weight. Something like the SOL escape bivy will likely stand up to your dog's nails or being stepped on. You can throw it over them if they are sleeping on your bag. The SOL Escape bivy is $70 and half a pound. If they sleep half on or sleep beside your bag, you might want to bring an additional Z pack sit pad for them to curl up on on cold nights. The sit pad is $30 and only 2 ounces. There are really good threads about winter camping over in ultralight and within this sub if you search. Much of it will be more gear than you need. But lots of the ideas and concepts can be modified to your specific use case. With all this knowledge, the best way to figure it out is to keep doing what you are doing. Backpacking teaches us so much about ourselves because it all comes down to what we need and what works for us in the places that we explore.",positive,positive,0.9816,positive,0.9986
m47to1o,Bringing your dog into your sleeping bag will really help both of you stay warm. If you think that's too gross at least get your dog a much better insulating layer (a thick sweater that covers most of his belly and legs as well as his back and fastens snugly so he won't slip out) as well as making sure he has insulation between his body and the ground.

m1ummja,"Ended our 13 months of traveling through South America with only two short weeks in Patagonia. Since pricing was a bit higher compared to other mountain regions on the continent, we opted to just visit the highlights in the region since our budget didn't quite allow for the slow travel we usually opt for. We almost decided to skip the section since we were arriving closer to peak season(American Thanksgiving) but decided to go ahead anyway. Glad we didn't because the place is gorgeous and definitely not as crowded as we had assumed. Places visited in order of pictures: Perito Moreno Glacier(Argentina) Easy to visit from the town of El Calafate(where you would most likely fly into). There were 5 of us so we found it cheaper and easier to rent a car than to take a bus back and forth. El Chalten(Argentina) - All hikes pretty much start from town. No need for a car here. Buses run between here and El Calafate frequently. The hikes we did: Laguna De los Tres hike for Alpenglow(2am start) Laguna Torre Loma Del Pliegue Tumbado There is a new ticketing system for this part of the Argentinian national parks. Pretty much went from free hiking to $40-45 per day for hiking. The community of El Chalten isn't too happy about it since none of the fees go towards the community itself. We returned back to El Calafate to take a bus to Puerto Natales to visit the Chilean side. We based ourselves in Puerto Natales and rented a car to do day trips in Torres Del Paine. Accommodation is pretty expensive in the park so driving back and forth(2 hours each way) was a better alternative though more grueling. The plus side was we always got early starts and left late to avoid busy crowds from buses. Torres Del Paine hikes(Chile) - Base Torres (Start early, like sunrise early. This is the most popular hike in the park and it gets very busy. On the way down we must have passed a good 500+ people). Condor Lookout Cuernos lookout Grey glacier lookout Puerto Natales itself is a decent town, a bit rough around the edges but has everything you need at a decent price. Will definitely be coming back to the region at some point in the future. This is just the small popular part of Patagonia, the actual region is huge and most people don't visit it due to less logistical options. Enjoy the pics!

m0h3x16,"This past summer, I hiked the John Muir Trail Northbound over the course of 20 days and three re-supplies. This hike is a crown jewel of California, traversing through some of the finest scenery the Sierra Nevada has to offer. Going northbound meant I had to summit Mount Whitney on the second day of the hike, it being the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States with an elevation of 14,505 feet. Honestly, a part of me really enjoyed getting that out of the way from the get go. These images are some of my favorite captures from the first couple of days. I ended up hiking this trail with a Canon R6 Mark II and the 16-35ml EF lens. Please excuse the water mark, I've had a ton of photos stolen from Reddit, especially from r/earthporn. It's a way of protecting my images along with a shameless plug to my [Instagram]( in case you'd like to see more of my work. Any interest in seeing a chronological style photo journal of the journey?

lqtgugc,"My plans to hike with a buddy got pushed back so I decided to do a different hike near Tahoe on my own. Loop starting at Echo Lake Sno-Park, taking the Hawley Grade National Recreation Trail and following the TRT & PCT looping back to the Sno-Park. This was my first time doing a solo overnight. It actually didn't feel too different than hiking with my SO as we spend a good portion of the time hiking in silence anyway lol. I had sent my tent poles off for repair so I bought a $30 10x10ft tarp and a 3x8 ft section of polyethelene house wrap as a ground sheet. Worked pretty well, so I'll likely be using it again for future trips where insects aren't too much of a concern. The pitch I used was a Adirondack wind shelter using a ridgeline (5mm covered dyneema). **Stats** Day 1: 15.31 mi, +3,175 ft, 6 hours 27 min moving time Day 2: 7.85 mi, +795 ft, 3 hours 47 min moving time Left the sno-park around 9:30 am Saturday and got back around 1 pm Sunday. I was pushing the pace a bit on the first day to gauge my strength and food requirements for a similar trip I have coming up. I definitely did not take in enough calories the first day and ended up bonking pretty hard (really bad headache through the night). Definitely need to add in easier calories like energy gels and drink powders for doing mileage like this (typically I would only do around 8-10 miles per day with my SO).",positive,positive,0.9664,positive,0.9979

1h0bdyp,"1. Language Barrier: My Chinese is close to non-existent. I used Duolingo Chinese and practised until I got to the chapter about travelling. SURPRISINGLY, those basic Duolingo phrases and vocabulary from baby level all the way until the chapter on travelling were more than sufficient to survive in China! 2. Alipay: I used Alipay EVERYWHERE. Just add your credit card to it before entering China. 3. Ordering Food in Restaurants: For ordering food in restaurants, I learned how to say this phrase in Chinese well: ""I'm a foreigner. Can I order through you?"" and they will say yes! You can use your translator app and show them the Chinese words too! Some of them spoke into a translator app on their phone or on mine. Either way, everyone was super friendly and patient to help you and translate for you. 4. Flight Booking: I bought some domestic flights through the China Eastern Airlines website. OUTSIDE OF CHINA, I couldn‚Äôt pick my seat. It kept saying, ""International flights can't select seat."" But once I got into China and connected to hotel Wi-Fi, I had absolutely no issues getting to the page to select my seat. So just buy the flight tickets first and once you're in China, visit the website and select your seats. 5. Passport Verification Issues: I had issues verifying passports on other, both in-app and on the website when I was outside of China. Once I got into China, I could verify easily and immediately! :) tripdotcom app and website work with foreign credit cards directly. 6. High-Speed Rail: Taking high-speed rail is insanely easy. Just go to the counter with a human and show them your passport. No communication needed. They know what to do. 7. Attraction Ticketing: All ticketing for attractions is done with your passport. Just bring your passport and go to the human counter. The human will either scan it or find your passport number in their device. They‚Äôre very used to foreigners showing up with passports. No communication needed. 8. Group Tours: I joined a few local group tours recommended by my hotel concierge that catered to local Chinese tourists and were all in the Chinese language. These were much cheaper than English tours (which were only private tours). No issues! The tour guides used translator apps to communicate with us, and some even added me on WeChat and sent me all the instructions there. WeChat has a built-in translator, so even if you reply in English, they know how to use it to translate it into Chinese before replying to you. The hilarious part is some other tour members really wanted to communicate with me and know where I'm from, so they added me on WeChat to text chat me during the tour with the in-built translator. 9. Solo Travel: I travelled mostly on my own and only booked day group tours recommended by the hotels after my arrival. I went to Chongqing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Wulong, and Beijing. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. 10. Food on Group Tours: The food the day group tours take you to eat is HORRENDOUS. BUT! The food I found on my own by randomly walking into local shopping malls was superb! So yeah... I guess the group tours need to profit and take you to only places they already had prior arrangements with, which in most cases aren‚Äôt great. 11. Street Food: I did not eat any street food, as a number of my friends got food poisoning on a previous trip. Not saying all street food is bad, but I had limited time and didn‚Äôt want to spend it being sick. I exclusively ate at restaurants inside shopping malls. 12. Cashless Payments: I used absolutely 0 cash. Alipay worked all the time! Yay! 13. 5G Everywhere: There is 5G like EVERYWHERE. And I mean really EVERYWHERE, even in the deepest mountain tourist attractions! I guess mobile network with strong data is everywhere even in the most remote areas, so people can pay with Alipay haha! 14. Didi for Cabs: Never flagged any cabs from the street. Exclusively used Didi. Absolutely no issues with finding pickup spots, nor communication. Once you're in China, you'll be able to download the Didi Greater China app. It's in English and works flawlessly with English names of places and recommended pickup points so you know where to walk to for waiting for your driver. The Didi Greater China app also works with my foreign credit card directly. 15. SIM Cards and Internet: I didn‚Äôt get any local SIM card. I got the Tripdotcom billion connect eSIM that had a VPN built-in. Had strong signal everywhere (see point 13) and was superfast. I even did a number of Zoom video calls in the midst of my trip and had absolutely 0 lag even when I was screen sharing. Hope this is helpful!

1g1vl4u,"Last week, I flew from Barcelona to Zurich for work, mainly to attend a marketing meeting about a new product launch. As the marketing manager, my job was to coordinate with local suppliers to ensure the smooth rollout of our new ski equipment in Switzerland. Since everything went so well, I wrapped up my tasks early and had some time to explore the city. While browsing forums, I stumbled upon a short trip advertisement on [trip.com]( for a visit to Rhine Falls, and I thought, why not? It was only ‚Ç¨57! We gathered at Sihlquai Coach Terminal in Zurich, which was super easy to find since it‚Äôs close to the main train station. Everyone was buzzing with excitement as we waited! Once we boarded the comfy, air-conditioned bus, we set off for Rhine Falls. The scenery along the way was breathtaking! The Swiss mountains and charming vineyards flew by outside the window, making me feel like I was in a postcard. When we finally arrived at Rhine Falls, I was completely blown away. This is the largest waterfall in Europe! Standing in the panoramic elevator, I was filled with excitement as I took in the view. It was incredible to see 700,000 liters of water rushing down every second, the roar was deafening, and the mist felt so refreshing against my face. I strolled along the paths, checking out different viewpoints. If you visit in the summer, you absolutely can‚Äôt miss the chance to take a boat ride right up to the falls. We also stopped by the Historama Museum to learn some fascinating history about the area. As the day came to an end, I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly the time flew by.

1ge3c8n,"Putting this up top now as people keep ignoring it: **ETA** they have been to the Madeira, canaries, all the short haul European destinations and don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a patch on Hawai‚Äôi So, **a friend of mine** has asked my advice about a destination for a special celebration holiday ""because you travel a lot"" and I have no clue what to suggest to them because we take quite different trips & I don't want to admit I don't know, lol. The key thing is that they fucking love Hawai'i. We're in the UK so it's quite a schlep over there, but they have managed to go twice and never stop talking about it. As far as I can tell the key criteria are 1. temperature reliably in the 20sC/70sF ideally in october/november 2. good clear waters for swimming and snorkling 3. solid tourist infrastructure - nice hotels with pools, all inclusives, if you want to get somewhere there's a tourbus or *easy* english-language friendly public transport BUT 3b. not just a resort island. There has to be an actual genuine non-tourist town or city, ideally multiple, to visit. 4. Stunning natural landscapes, ideally green/forest/seascapes, not necessarily to spend time in, but to enjoy from a distance e.g. in a helicopter tour or from the viewing platform of your luxury lodge. 5. Non-challenging in terms of logistics and, frankly, poverty. changing plane once at a major airport is OK, but not having to bundle on to a little sea plane or get 2 ferries to your destination after 18 hours of flying from the UK; if people come up to your on the beach begging or hassling you to buy stuff that's an instant nope, etc. A lot of places I know anything about have fallen foul of point 5 (plus ""too many poisonous animals"" for bits of Australia), while all the more luxe places like the Maldives tend to (also) fail on point 3b.

I recommend staying in Santa Cruz de Tenerife rather than the beach resorts to get a more authentic feel and take advantage of the bus network. However that part of the island is mainly Spanish mainland tourists so don‚Äôt count on English being widely spoken everywhere. Madeira and the Azores will assuredly have many more English speakers.

They have a lot of nice resorts to stay at, but also beach houses you can rent on the water, which is an awesome experience, and more fun.

1h2npop,"Currently on a short trip to Uruguay which was almost an afterthought to visit another country while I'm in South America. Didn't think much of it before I visited but boy was I wrong. Montevideo is a curious little capital city with an edge. Full of good cafes, museums, fantastic architecture. Good shopping. Punta del Diablo and Cabo Polonio must be the most beautiful beach towns I've ever visited. I'm here just before the summer season starts and the towns are still sleepy and quiet but the weather is perfect. Beautiful clear water. At least for a traveller, the country is well organised, everything is easy to sort out, transport is very efficient. Clean and much less busy than a lot of surrounding countries. Super easy to get to from Buenos Aires and the bus network is great to get you to any coastal town. The fish is top quality. But most of all it's the vibe across the whole country. Safe, slow, chilled all across. People are incredibly friendly. I love travelling and have been around but not often do I get the feeling that I could just move somewhere. I started researching how to move to Uruguay on my second day haha. No wonder Anthony Bourdain loved it so much. That's it! If you have a few days to spare, definitely spend a few days in Uruguay. Most people only visit for a day or two but the country deserves much more recognition than it gets. It's anything but boring.

The Eastern Turkey I visited in 2023, crisscrossed by expressways, with many of its once scenic and historic areas submerged by hydroelectric headponds as of the late 2010s, with half of historic old-town Diyarbakir razed in a military operation in 2016, and with many of its small towns forcibly evicted in ‚Äúanti-terrorism‚Äù operations, is completely unrecognizable compared the one a colleague visited in the early 2010s. The Albania I visited in 2021 was still holding onto its quaintness, but it seemed like highway right-of-ways were being staked out everywhere, some of its quaint natural areas were already attracting too much tourism-oriented development, and much of the once-wild coastline has been developed into hotels and resorts even in the past 3-4 years. The Taipei I visited this year seems to be rapidly gentrifying away much of its neon and grit in favour of cookie-cutter gentrification development; I still enjoyed Taipei, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt the city described by a friend who visited it in 2008. This isn‚Äôt even getting to things like war-level changes or permanent political unrest; I guess I‚Äôm just illustrating that some of the more-interesting sites and atmosphere of a place can be irretrievably lost in a short time, even without war/unrest/natural disasters. Also, just a note - India is a much ‚Äúharder‚Äù place to travel than parts of sub-Saharan Africa are.

I spent time in Tegucigalpa and San Salvador around 2010-2012 whenever the crime there was at its peak. It was terrible there, but I won‚Äôt compare Moresby to that. I also spent some time with some peace corps volunteers around Vanuatu and around the South Pacific. Port Vila is a similar situation, although slightly better than Port Moresby. The best way that I can describe it is that my ‚Äúspidey sense‚Äù for a bad situation wasn‚Äôt as well calibrated for Moresby/Vila. I can easily sus out the good and bad parts in town pretty much anywhere in Latin America or Africa, but in the South Pacific the scale of the cities is so different and the culture and rhythm of life was so foreign to me that I could never get a good feel of the situation. I spent a month in South Pacific Islands, but still never got comfortable moving around the capital city without good local experience. I recommend you seek local guidance and follow their advice. Ask around with hotel and restaurant staff about what to do and where to go. The tourist attractions will be very limited, so temper your expectations. Don‚Äôt go for huge ambitious adventures. Stick to easy stuff - like tourist markets and museums unless you have locals with you that know.",positive,positive,0.9517,positive,0.999

Carjackings, muggings and worse are common. Women are particularly at risk. Foreigners are sometimes specifically targeted. As such, it has been rated as one of the least livable cities in the world. >There is a great deal of concern about the level of crime and civil disorder and about the ability and willingness of the police to cope. Police officers have been found to be complicit in major crime. Police brutality against minor offenders, complainants and witnesses has been the subject of criticism from the international group Human Rights Watch. >It is possible to minimise the chances of becoming a victim of crime by being aware of your surroundings, avoiding places where large groups are gathered and avoiding places where offences are prevalent. The Waigani area, particularly the area around the traffic lights and the Port Moresby Golf Club, has experienced numerous carjackings. The Morata district is well known by locals for its riots during the weekends. It's best to not walk between locations in Port Moresby, or travel at night. >Still, the local people are mainly friendly and peaceful. The main risks are from idle young people, mostly having fun and struggling for money. But traditionally, a wrong or bad or negative behaviour often has the other side of the mirror, which is known as ""pay back"", also called in some cases compensation, but always wild and violent. >It is always wise to seek the advice of a person familiar with Port Moresby before venturing into unknown areas. >**Saltwater crocodiles** (*Crocodylus porosus*) are still common throughout all of Papua New Guinea.

Especially since it‚Äôs not a well visited place and some of the information you find online might be outdated in both good and bad ways. Finding people who might have gone in recent history is a better bet because in places that aren‚Äôt as stable the situation can change depending on politics, natural disasters, economy etc. My uncle went there are part of some humanitarian aid group many years ago and said it was the sketchiest most miserable place he has ever been too. He described it as post apocalyptic. He said there was pockets of beauty and overall laid back and homey vibe, but every nook and cranny was filled with alcoholism, rape, violent assault, riots, mob justice and even doing things like walking to the store or taking a jog required a guard who had experience on how to keep cool if someone pulls a gun or machete on you. His buddy got in a car accident and people tried to rob him and his driver while they were waiting for help. Now this was years ago so maybe the situation is better.

Though yes, if you're in a car, the windows will be closed and tinted to the max. The national museum is worth checking out (though I missed it since it was closed the day I arrived), as is the nature park. You'll also find excellent food and some malls. You could get a taxi to the beach/Apec building, the fish market or see if you can visit the floating village Hanuabada. But other than that, there's not much to do. I had a female friend stay solo in one of the big hotels and even she walked around in the day just fine, though she saw nothing really of interest. You'll see Aussies everywhere in some areas.

Anyone chewing betelnut might seem a bit highwired to you. Don't pick an argument with anyone. That said, I've felt much more unsafe in Latin American cities for comparison. In terms of my experience, I had forgotten about the visa requirement so on the day booked an onward flight to Manila along with making the visa application. When I was connecting in Port Moresby, I saw that it was issued, so just off boarded and walked out. Had no idea and nowhere to stay, but the airline staff helped me out and drove me to a nice B&B. That place wasn't expecting a guest but set it up for me. Another airline staff member drove me around the city for sightseeing, also took me to one of the slums and I drank there with the locals.

Most people don't live in the high traffic tourist areas, so there's nothing for them to complain about since only a part of their day involves dealing with tourists for 95% of the city (and for some of us, 0% of our day because we also don't work in touristy areas).

I was lucky enough to stay in Palermo SoHo, and it was just a dream. The trees, restaurants, bars. Everything felt so alive, so unlike the small American town where I'm from. Anytime I went on social media or called friends back home, I'd hear the same stories about the same people. I knew that what I was doing was different. This was a life most people could only dream of. However, about a month in, that facade started to break. I couldn't speak Spanish very well, and the difference in Argentine Spanish is no joke. I'd go out around 3 times per week trying to meet people, with little success. I met some fellow nomads, but no one who I was really able to connect with. When it came to the locals, they were incredibly friendly, but it was clear they weren't actually looking to form relationships with foreigners. By the time I left, I was very grateful to be moving on. The beginning of my stay was like a drug, I didn't understand how I ever lived without it.

Beyond finding your favorite bars, cafes, & restaurants, or throwing back a pint on Gringo Tuesdays at the local DN/expat meetup, there's a couple of things you just have to do to get the most out of your experiences here. 1. **Learn Spanish (or Portuguese if in Brazil)** \- It will 10x the depth and surface area of your connections and experiences as a nomad when you don't have to constrain every meaningful interaction to the minority of English speakers in the area. 2. **Take Dancing Lessons** \- Dance is its own universal language. In LATAM, knowing salsa & bachata will unlock some of the best side quests you can imagine... You'd be surprised what adventures can manifest when you start dancing in the street during a street fair and have reasonable command of the local language. 3. **Find a Community-Oriented Gym -** As a slomad, there's not much of an excuse not to get in the best possible shape of your adult life, but finding gyms that already have community baked into the pie is often the secret ingredient to staving off loneliness as well.

1ev3pij,"So about a year ago, my partner and I decide to move to Barcelona because we found it was the simplest visa to get to be able to stay together, we had some friends here, and we speak Spanish, so Catalan couldn't be too hard. 1- The visa process The visa itself is SO backed up, I almost would warn against even trying anymore. I've been in the process of trying to attain mine with a lawyer since January. I am currently still stuck waiting for one of the many steps/appointments in this process made of beaurocratic nightmare fuel. I have probably sent 100-200 emails to my lawyer and and the various agencies you need to work with ,paid maybe 4-5K for the various docs and postage and steps, (background checks, diplomas, translation, apostilles). Also, I have a few appointments and a few(2-5?) months of waiting to go. You can't even make appointments early. They release them once a week and you HAVE to hire someone to make the appointment for you these days due to the backup and confusing system. By the way, all I'm trying to do Is get my fingerprints taken. It's going to take 5 months. While Waiting for this, you technically get stuck in Spain until those go through due to visa and Schengen days running out. Yes, I've been here 90 days and my time is up although I reply to my lawyer promptly and they file things just as promptly. If you want to leave, you have to make ANOTHER appointment to get a permission slip to leave/return (""regresso""). 2. Overtourism Basically, if the locals can spot that you aren't local and/or don't speak Spanish well, they resent you. I get the overtourism issues. But we were invited here, are responsible residents, and they don't care. 3. Safety This is not a safe city. I have only lived here 3 months. I have already been involved in a home robbery by two armed intruders (I was home and they came into my room!) In one supposedly nice area(Eixample). In the second incident this week in Gr√†cia, I was just attacked with one of those water guns to the face. It wasn't filled with water. I don't know what the hell was in that thing but it stung my eyes. People wax on about the ""good and bad areas"" but I purposefully stay in safer areas due to traumas I have from growing up in an unsafe area and some terrorist attacks I've been in. I cringe thinking about how much worse off I'd be if I spent more time in what[local] friends warn are dangerous areas. I'm literally thinking of moving already. I've never felt so unsafe anywhere I've lived. This city's government does not care about you, nor the Catalan people who are attacking you out of hatred. If they cared, they would make a campaign against violence, criminalise the rising water gun attacks, which is assault in some countries already, or increase the investigation and prosecution sentences of petty criminals. Nothing. Crickets. 4. The Catalans don't give a shit about your safety After I was hit with the mystery liquid water pistol, I warned others at the event to watch out, in a locals group on WhatsApp. The leader didn't ask if I was ok, they reprimanded ME in front of everyone for being racist towards Catalan for inferring to be careful ... As an illustrative point, I have tried to post in r/Barcelona about my experience and either the Mods don't let it in or they make fun of me and twist my words to make me the bad guy. A post will gain some sympathy then is quickly hit with a rapid fire downvote of hate like I've never seen. Comments are by what feels like kids. I assume they might be? 5. Renting a flat Either because of their resentment towards you or just taking advantage, their renting system makes it almost impossible to rent a flat without being rinsed with a ""foreigner fee"". I don't know if that's the same in other parts of Spain, though. Unbeknownst to some, it's illegal for agencies to charge you an agency fee... Yet most agents refuse to rent to you if you don't have a Spanish employer, unless you pay certain agencies extortionate fees (thousands of euros). So we pay the fee to have a home. They know you're only here looking for a flat as a foreigner if you're a DV or rich expat, and that you have no other option, so you pay or you are in some other extortionate agreement like the long term rentals the locals ""hate so much"". We're only here because we can't get am actual flat without paying those crazy fees. Anyways, you have the right to share your positive experience about Barcelona and defend it as a great place... but know that the locals literally don't want you to, and you aren't welcome here.

A factoid of uncanny interest: Re Wizard of Oz - from DEBT, a book by anthropologist David Graeber: ‚ÄúCredit Theorists have long been hobbled by the lack of an equally compelling narrative. This is not to say that all sides in the currency debates that ranged between 1850 and 1950 were not in the habit of deploying mythological weaponry. This was true particularly, perhaps, in the United States. In 1894, the Greenbackers, who pushed for detaching the dollar from gold entirely to allow the government to spend freely on job-creation campaigns, invented the idea of the March on Washington‚Äîan idea that was to have endless resonance in U.S. history. L. Frank Baum‚Äôs book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which appeared in 1900, is widely recognized to be a parable for the Populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan, who twice ran for president on the Free Silver platform‚Äîvowing to replace the gold standard with a bimetallic system that would allow the free creation of silver money alongside gold. As with the Greenbackers, one of the main constituencies for the movement was debtors: particularly, Midwestern farm families such as Dorothy‚Äôs, who had been facing a massive wave of foreclosures during the severe recession of the 1890s. According to the Populist reading, the Wicked Witches of the East and West represent the East and West Coast bankers (promoters of and benefactors from the tight money supply), the Scarecrow represented the farmers (who didn‚Äôt have the brains to avoid the debt trap), the Tin Woodsman was the industrial proletariat (who didn‚Äôt have the heart to act in solidarity with the farmers), the Cowardly Lion represented the political class (who didn‚Äôt have the courage to intervene). The yellow brick road, silver slippers, emerald city, and hapless Wizard presumably speak for themselves. ‚ÄúOz‚Äù is of course the standard abbreviation for ‚Äúounce.‚Äù As an attempt to create a new myth, Baum‚Äôs story was remarkably effective. As political propaganda, less so. William Jennings Bryan failed in three attempts to win the presidency, the silver standard was never adopted, and few nowadays even remember what The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was originally supposed to be about.‚Äù Excerpt From DEBT Who knew?",positive,positive,0.8217,positive,0.9996

m00qcw9,"An easy trick to make it cheaper: Stay in Osaka. You'll get there with 35EUR/n. Surprisingly Okinawa is similar in price but I personally don't recommend Okinawa that much. I repeat, Japan is cheap. But yeah if you go to the local bars it'll get expensive pretty quick. You can also just snag a beer in the convenience store to balance out the prices. Food is more expensive than the rest of Asia but the chains like Matsunoya (variant of Matsuya) provide very good quality food for barely 4-5 EUR. The only negative thing I'd say is that supporting local business is a lot more expensive than going to chains. I personally struggle more with the wi-fi. They do not have wi-fi everywhere and it can be of bad quality. I've been in AirBnB's with horrenduous wifi. The local starbucks and so on can have very questionable wifi. Many places don't even have wifi. Otherwise I think the review is quite balanced. We all have different experiences but I agree with some points I've never been able to highlight or pinpoint. Japan has variety, when you wander around you will always find new things that you would not expect. Some weird niche store, some older gentleman that wants to practice English etc. And wandering around is safe, fun, easy because of transport. Just absolutely pleasant.

Short term (monthly) rentals have to be done by actually finding reputable LOCAL sites of companies that have furnished rentals without any contract/key/deposit requirements. If one uses Airbnb or Booking or straight to hotel (APA) instead, they can expect to overpay by 200-350%. Rental prices in this case can be ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. Without an annual contract, for example, it is hard to stay in Pattaya Thailand under $750-900/month. An equivalent room, maybe a tad bit smaller, in Tokyo can be had for the same price range.

And no, using spices to cover the mediocre quality of the food or the taste of produce doesn't mean it's better outside of Japan. Obviously this is subjective, but if you feel the food in japan was bland, I don't know where you've been eating. 2. Japan isn't that expensive. Of course, if you compare it with Vietnam, it will be. If we're talking land/real estate prices, sure, very expensive (like any G-10 country). But compared to many western places, it isn't expensive or at least not THAT expensive.

m00gldi,"The two notes I'd have about Japan being expensive are 1. Japan isn't that expensive compared to North America or Western Europe (or at least, that's my experience) in terms of daily cost of living. Having said that, if you compare it to the rest of Asia, it's not so cheap. Which somewhat leads to 2. Japan isn't that expensive to live in AS A RESIDENT. But even that comes with caveats, which is to say you may not find somewhere you WANT to live within your budget, but I would contend that the fact that you CAN find something (even if not a great thing) is better than many western countries (which often don't have low budget options for single people). Basically, Japan is as expensive as your needs, and if you can survive on very little (space/etc), then you can survive on a very small budget. But again, that's not so much for travelers. Nomads are in a weird in-between area, but generally speaking the normal options for residents won't be available afaik, which means it's going to be pricey (competing with all the other tourists). Also the fruit thing is strange to me (coming from Canada/US), as the fruit here is much better/tastier than anything I can find in America. If you're comparing to the rest of SEA, then sure, but it's like saying you can get better pineapple in Hawaii than New York... it seems pretty obvious fresh fruit is more plentiful and fresher in areas where it grows natively. Japan is big on seasons... there's always going to be SOME fruit in season, it's just a matter of getting the right thing at the right time.",positive,positive,0.9612,positive,0.998

I consider myself fortunate enough to have done my backpacking in 2008-2009. I *had access* to internet, but it was something you had to seek out and pay for. I didn't have a smartphone, or a laptop so I couldn't log on to wifi. I literally had to go to an internet cafe, or nab the one computer terminal at the hostel. I have backpacked (shorter trips, a few weeks max) since, and maybe its me or maybe its the tech but: i) it feels less organic these days -you are booking everywhere in advance, you never just show up at a small town and find a hostel anymore. You also have seen or heard of most of the experiences you want to do before you get there - so they are less of a surprise to you, and can be underwhelming because of that. Before, the only real pre-cursor you had was a short paragraph in a lonely planet. No photos, and certainly no influencer videos. ii) it is less possible to disconnect from home. You are literally connected constantly to all of the people from your life at home - your parents, friends, grandparents, employers etc. It makes it more difficult to just truly live in that moment. Some of the best times in my backpacking days were just lazing around on some outdoor deck with a view of a river or soemtihg playing backgammon with random Danes or Colombians, fellow hostel guests. Or playing cards with some locals in Cambodia.

1dl9ko3,"[Screenshot \/ Article from Forbes]( Jun 21, 2024, The mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, has today announced a controversial and drastic move to get rid of all short-term apartment rentals for tourists by 2028. # Rising living costs in Barcelona The boom in short-term rental apartments in Barcelona has caused a significant increase in living costs in the Catalan capital. Many residents are unable to afford an apartment after rents have risen by close to 70% in the past 10 years, while the cost of buying a home has increased by almost 40%, Collboni said at a City Council meeting on 21 June, adding that access to housing has become a driver of inequality, particularly for young people. This has led the local government to take drastic measures to guarantee access to housing in the city, the mayor of Barcelona continued. ""We cannot permit that the majority of young people who wish to leave home also have to leave Barcelona,"" said Collboni, [according to leading Spanish newspaper El Pais]( The issue of overtourism has been a growing concern in Barcelona in recent years. # Spain, the second most-visited country in the world Spain is one of the [most-visited countries in the world]( According to a report published by Statista in June 2024, the country‚Äôs visitor numbers are second only to those of France, having received more than 85 million international tourists in 2023, a higher number than the pre-pandemic record of 83 million in 2019. Meanwhile, Catalonia, with its capital city Barcelona, was [the region of Spain that received the most international tourists in 2023]( In recent years it has become increasingly tricky to obtain permission for short-term apartment rentals in Barcelona. Since 2012, a tourist licence has been required in order to legally rent out an apartment defined as a ‚ÄúVivienda de Uso Tur√≠stico‚Äù (home for tourism use) in Barcelona for a duration of fewer than 31 days. Last year, the rules were tightened with licenses being limited to a maximum of ten tourist apartments per 100 inhabitants. In addition, the city put an end to permanent licenses for tourist apartments, instead forcing them to be renewed every five years. The local government has also been redoubling its efforts to hunt down and shutter illegal tourist rentals. Barcelona's Gothic Quarter gets especially crowded during the busy the summer season. # The war against illegal tourist apartments These measures have resulted in the shutting down of 9,700 illegal tourist rentals since 2016, while almost 3,500 apartments have been converted back into housing for local residents. Today‚Äôs move is the most drastic to date, one that the leading Barcelona-based daily newspaper [La Vanguardia predicts will result in a ""bloody judicial war""]( If Mayor Collboni gets his way, the City Council will eliminate the 10,101 licensed tourist apartments currently in the city no later than November 2028. His move, which has left the tourism sector stunned, is expected to be opposed by various players, not least the employers‚Äô association of Barcelona's tourist apartments, and will likely result in a drawn-out legal battle. Meanwhile, vacation rental platform Airbnb, which hosts a considerable number of Barcelona‚Äôs short-term rental listings, has not yet made an official [statement.Barcelona]( Announces Plan To Ban Tourist Rental Apartments By 2028 [Isabelle Kliger]( Announcement came early this afternoon via El Pais: [",negative,negative,0.8595,negative,0.9317

AirBnb didn‚Äôt create that problem, though their platform certainly made it easy to do. Human behavior often serves the interests of the self with disregard for others.

1dqgrcm,"Hey fellow travellers, If you're planning a trip to Thailand, you're in for an amazing adventure! Thailand is a beautiful country with vibrant culture, stunning beaches, and delicious food. Here are some essential tips to keep in mind to make your journey smoother and more enjoyable: **1)** **Respect the Local Culture-** Thailand is known for its rich culture and traditions. Always dress modestly when visiting temples and religious sites. It's also important to show respect by removing your shoes before entering someone's home or a sacred place. **2)Use Reliable Transportation-** For long distances, opt for reputable transportation options like trains, buses, or domestic flights. Within cities, consider using metered taxis, Grab (a popular ride-hailing app), or tuk-tuks. Always agree on a fare before starting your ride in a tuk-tuk. **3)Be Cautious with Street Food**:- Thai street food is delicious and a must-try! However, choose vendors that look clean and have a high turnover of food to avoid any stomach issues. Stick to bottled water and avoid ice unless you're sure it's made from filtered water. **4**)**Bargain Politely**:- Markets in Thailand are great places to shop for souvenirs, but bargaining is common. Always negotiate with a smile and be respectful. Remember, it's part of the culture and should be done politely. **5)Learn Basic Thai Phrases-** Learning a few basic Thai phrases like ""hello"" (sawasdee), ""thank you"" (khob khun), and ""excuse me"" (kor tod) can go a long way in showing respect and making local interactions smoother. **6)Keep Your Valuables Safe**:- Petty theft can happen, especially in crowded areas. Use a money belt or a secure bag to keep your valuables safe, and be mindful of your belongings at all times. **7)Stay Aware of Scams**:- Like any popular tourist destination, scams can occur. Be cautious of overly friendly strangers offering deals that seem too good to be true, and always verify information with trusted sources.",positive,positive,0.9962,positive,0.9989

Great Chinese, Taiwanese, and the most authentic Japanese food you'll find outside Japan but for a lower cost. The people are *incredibly* friendly, warm, and welcoming to visitors - especially when you leave Taipei and the biggest tourist spots. The landscape has a lot of variety for a relatively small island - rice paddies on the east, mountains run through the center, a little flatter on the west but that's where larger cities are, and beaches toward the south. The coastline in the north is also very pretty! There's history here, but you have to look a little harder to find it. Japan has incredible architecture that's been well-maintained or recreated over the years. Trains wisk you away to practically anywhere you want to go. You can feel like you're going back in time in some of the historic areas. Their landscape is stunning, hiking opportunities exist everywhere (we hiked in Taiwan, but it's more prolific in Japan). Japan is much larger than Taiwan and is so varied that we keep going back to explore new places. While there are WAY more travelers to Japan, you can get away from tourists by leaving the popular places behind (Taiwan has few tourists, especially once you leave Taipei - it rarely felt crowded to us). The Japanese, while extremely polite and helpful, are also more reserved with foreigners. Japan is more expensive than Taiwan. We made visiting Taiwan a priority because we're uncertain of its political future and we plan to return in 2025 (but tbf, we'll probably also go back to Japan üòÇ).

I've been one of the victims of their scam losing RM1100 in total. Fortunately, I was able to get one of the scammers identity card picture which they sent to me via WhatsApp and all the banks accounts they asked me to transfer money used to run their scam. I hope everyone benefits from my comment and that the fraudster scammers gets exposed and arrested as soon as possible since they are still active on the website scamming others. Below are all the proofs and details with the conversation that took place between us via WhatsApp which includes one of the suspected scammer's identity card, invalid phone numbers they use to scam & contact people via WhatsApp, fake invoices, various bank accounts for other suspected individuals in the fraud scamming gang. I also include screenshots of all other 10 properties that are listed under the same scammer's gang under the user's name: Muhammad alhakim. Please do take note of these bank accounts and phone numbers so that you don't get cheated and scammed by them.

What he did is very wrong and he should be facing the consequences. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could even suggest paying your rent is sufficient punishment. I‚Äôm saying this because I know people who have been sexually assaulted. Unfortunately they did not report them. What came of it was them repeatedly try to assault other girls because they didn‚Äôt face any consequences. They are animals who don‚Äôt have a shred of humanity and all sexual assaulters, from what I‚Äôve seen, act the same way regardless of how they apologize.

Malay is a race. Since there's multiple races in malaysia, its gonna be something like malaysian malay, Malaysia chinese, Malaysian indian etc. 2) malaysian society don't put as much emphasis on beauty as much as korean society do. Don't get me wrong, beautiful people are still looked up to put not to the point people need to do plastic surgery just to be treated normal. 3) malaysian weather is warm and humid, thus outdoor activities are usually only done early in the morning or evenings. Any other time, most people prefer indoors. Therefore you will see alot of shopping malls that are far bigger with much more variety of amneties compared to the ones you find in korea. 4) be very careful of your belongings as malaysia is general not as safe as korea. Don't leave your belongings unsupervised. Be very careful of your handbag especially when you are walking beside a road as snatch thieves may snatch your bag and seriously injure you when you fall on the road. Don't leave any bags visible in a car when you parked the car because of break in. 5) be careful of scammers. Don't believe any sad story of a random stranger or a beggar you may encounter. They will invent a sad story and compel you to give em some money but in actual fact they don't need it. 6) food here is extremely varied and delicious and is usually the selling point for malaysia. Eat well here but also be careful as cuisine here can be quite unhealthy because of high fat and high sugar content. 7) since you are in university, try to mingle with the locals instead of just sticking to koreans only for the best experience. Joining clubs and societies will help you to meet new people. 8) malaysia is afterall a muslim majority nation and is still relatively conservative. Therefore try not to dress too sexily.

My parents sent me an itinerary they liked the look of, and I've adapted it to add a few days where I think we could do with more time. My main question is whether it's worth doing a night in Malacca or whether we should do it as a day trip from KL? This ties in to my questions around getting around. If we went straight to KL, I assume it's easier to fly - but if we stopped for a night in Malacca, would it be best to get coaches or hire a car between there and Penang? I've read it's worth having a car for Cameron Highlands, but not sure where else we'd need it. This is what I've got so far for the itinerary - really appreciate any feedback/thoughts/comments and anything I'm really missing! Thanks!

mv0n6mg,"I just did this trip last year with my early 60's parent, but in reverse! Singapore --> flew to Langkawi --> combo ferry x grab to station x commuter train x grab to hotel (sounds like a lot but was cheap and actually very comfortable/straightforward) to Penang --> high speed rail to KL --> flight back to Singapore. My take was KL was really fun to explore and worth spending time in. We did a number of tours to learn more about the history, spent time wandering Chinatown, etc. We ran out of time to do everything there because things are a bit spread out and it can take a while with traffic to get to different parts of the city. I was talked out of Cameroon highlands and Malacca for the same reasons (if you've been, I also found Hoi An too touristy so depends on what you like). I don't regret spending more time in KL. Personally, I would skip Malacca and spend more time in KL, and if you can afford to in Singapore (those hotel prices are no joke...at least for my budget!). There was a whole half of the island/hiking/eco walks we just ran out of time for. The only other thing I would do if I had more time was the Perhentian islands on the east coast...if you're looking for great snorkeling/swimming this could be a swap out but you'd need to fly in. Otherwise, the Singapore --> Bus to Malacca --> Malacca to KL route makes sense and was one I researched. Just prepare for a loooong drive.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

We depart from Kuala Lumpur at 7PM on Wednesday, 30th April. I'm hoping to spend 4-6 days in Penang at Rasa Sayang Shangri La in Penang, mostly relaxing, eating and drinking with perhaps a day trip into Georgetown. The other potential areas to visit are an island (Langkawi/Redang/Perhention/Tioman), Ipoh, Cameron Highlands or Malacca. Obviously we won't be able to fit all of this into our time here.

If you want an island, Langkawi will be the easiest from Penang.Tioman,Perhentians etc are too far out of your way. Ipoh is great logistically but quite similar to Georgetown... great food,old buildings, temples etc. Cameron Highlands is between Penang and KL... are you interested in what there is to do there? Tea plantations, some hiking, lots of 'tourist attractions ' aimed at Malaysian tourists. Malacca is nice but also similar to Georgetown (and Ipoh) in what it offers All the places are worth visiting for me, and I've been to them all multiple times, but you only have a few days.I'd choose one in that timeframe.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

In fact, I would suggest your last 2 days or last day be at any of the resorts on Pantai Cenang (that's also where you cross to/from Rebak). And nearest to the airport. So, although it's very near, it would be best to cross back to mainland from Rebak only when you are done with the island, to maximize your time there. Kilim and the mangroves would be best together since they're near each other. Dedicate a whole day to the Skybridge since it takes too long as there are always too many people (unless you go there very early morning).

Google tells me Malaysia will be pretty quiet over those dates, but it seems Penang/Georgetown has some street festival type things we could possibly check out so I framed my itinerary around being in Penang over CNY. Regardless, we are ok just hanging out in a hotel and doing what we can. It's also possible that we could be in Langkawi over the holiday, so I'm hoping for a stronger opinion on where would be best to spend the holiday. Had to consider the weather too. Would've liked to do the Perhentian Islands over Langkawi. Additionally, heard that traffic to Cameron Highlands before a holiday will be bonkers.... We are ok with eliminating Cameron Highlands all together and then using those days for either; Malacca (before KL) more days in KL, Ipoh, or open to wherever else you might suggest. My partner and I are pretty chill travellers. We just like hanging out in other places. We like cities and good food. Smaller places are cool too. We love nature, but not to the extreme. We like snorkeling, waterfalls, hiking and pretty views. Would love to do Borneo someday, but it seemed a bit more involved than we want for this trip, I think.

Be prepared to get off the Banana Pancake Trail and away from the usual tourist centres every now and then.

I've been to Thailand for two weeks and it wasn't enough. Really amazing country. That's definitely my recommendation over the others.

1lfm2fw,"HI guys, I was fired from my job last month and I decided that it is very good time to spend more time with my family. We had this little dream that one day we will just take one year off and travel around the world. The unexpected scenario made us do it quicker and travel for shorter period. We decided to travel a little bit to areas we've never been before. We want to visit a few countries which are interesting to us. However it is going to be very slow paced travelling because we've got two kids: 3 yo and 1 yo. We are aiming to find a very cozy places, with a swimming pool, quite close to nice beaches and not so far from towns or cities which we can find good food. We want to go sightseeing a little bit because we want to learn about interesting places and culture, too. So below you will find our plan and I'd love to get some feedback from you. What do you think about it, what do you suggest, what would you change and what tips do you have. Dates are more or less like those below. Those might change a little bit but not so much. We plan to stay around 3 weeks in each country. Most likely we will around 10 days in each place, so 2 places per country. 01.08 - 22.08 Vietnam We plan to stay around Da Nang. We learned that during this time central Vietnam would be the best place to stay and avoid monsoons. We are aware that we will experience high temperatures but hey - that's a part of experience. What do you suggest would be a nice second area to visit and stay? What about Con Dao? Is that a good idea to go there or rain season will ruin our time there? 23.08 - 14.09 Thailand We planned to visit Thai Gulf - Koh Samui. We are still looking for a second destination. We are also open for island hopping so maybe a different island would be recommended. 15.09 - 25.09 Malaysia This one is shorter because we want to travel to Malaysia ""mainland's"" East Coast. Which area would you recommend? 26.09 - 18.10 Indonesia We are looking for a first destination for first 7-10 days and then we will go to Bali. Any recommendations are welcome. 19.10 - 30.10 Malaysia - North Borneo I learned about Borneo a little bit and I feel like it is a place I want to visit. We want to avoid travelling with little kids as much as possible so that's why we want to stay in one or two places maximum. We know we will miss a lot because of this but we don't really care. It is a journey we want to make to experience other part of the world and come closer as a family. My questions below apply to each of the destination. Any of your suggestions and tips are welcome. 1. We want to find nice houses/villas (whatever you call it) with nice, clean standard and preferably garden and/or swimming pool. There might be some days that we won't do anything except spend time home. Do you have any recommendation on specific places? Which sites or apps would you suggest to use to find one? I know a lot of people book the hotel or house when arriving to the country of destination but I don't really want to do it that way. 2. Which things absolutely avoid in each country? I mean like dangerous events, potential scams etc. 3. Which areas do you recommend for staying in certain period of time and fitting to our agenda (nice area, beautiful beaches, a lot of things to see) 4. My wife cannot eat wheat. Basically we call it gluten free diet to make it easier. Anything you recommend on doing when visiting to avoid eating it? 5. Which food is absolutely must-try? 6. Which places in certain areas would you recommend visiting? We love nature, breathtaking views, ruins, historical building, anything culture and religion related (temples, pagodas, monuments). We are open to places that we would have to travel a little bit to see (let's say 1-2h car/bus/train drive in one direction). 7. Potential health issues - any precautions we should take? Vacs to take (I know it's polarizing topic), meds to take, insurance value you suggest. 8. Elephant sanctuary - are there any ""ethical"" sanctuaries where elephants are actually treated well and are located near areas we will be? We don't want to ride them, bath them etc. Just being near them will be enough. 9. Bugs and so on. What sprays to take to avoid mosquitoes, jiggers and so on. What to do to avoid unsuspected guests in boots, clothes, whatever. I basically hate anything that crawls so this will be a hard one for me. 10. My goal for this trip is to learn (or at least try and experience) some kind of sport, most likely a water sport like surfing or anything else actually. Is there any chance to do it while staing in places I suggested. 11. We are also thinking about extending our trip by around 1 month. We were thinking about visiting Cambodia or other closely located countries. Do you have any suggestions? tl;dr - please share your suggestions, tips and what to avoid when traveling to those countries.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mypraqt,"I can answer a few questions I think I know well 2. Near the Thai Malay border on the Thai side there‚Äôs a few provinces that are kinda dangerous not recommended for travel, it‚Äôs fine tho if u travel near the west coast across the Thai Malay border. The only other dodgy area is the islands off north east Borneo have a kidnapping risk that area is not recommended. Safety wise the scams are pretty similar to like every other country, some random ones, taxi/ tuktuk drivers telling u a place is closed when it‚Äôs not and taking u to a different place for a lot of money, scams with renting equipment and being told u caused damage when u didn‚Äôt, just stuff being overpriced, like taxis use grab or negotiate the price. Other risks are food safety so be careful with what you eat and also the traffic can be quite crazy be careful 4. U will struggle like a lot just in terms of labelling of allergens in places not being very common. Google to death 10 gluten free restaurants for every destination u end up in or cook in ur accommodation. Relying on random people with cards saying you have an allergy to not put wheat in the food would be quite risky you would probably get ill at least once but u can try that 7. U don‚Äôt need any vaccinations as just a standard tourist wandering round the regular tourist route just bug spray and also endless suncream 11. There isn‚Äôt a month worth of things to do in Cambodia but u can also go to Laos which is a very interesting country, or just book a flight outside of south east Asia if u feel like it to Hong Kong China Taiwan depends what ur nationality allows easily passport wise tbh",positive,positive,0.9731,positive,1.0

ljjowa6,"Hi! I went on a trip to Malaysia for 9 days in mid July. People don‚Äôt travel to this place from my country all that much, since there are more popular spots such as in Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan etc. This sparked my curiosity, and I decided to travel there to see what they have to offer. Turns out, I had one of the most fun as a tourist, in Malaysia! Had amazing food, great views and was able to experience how diverse Malaysia was. Only downside was how short the trip was, I wish I could experience more of this country. Here are explanations of the images posted. 1. Petronas Twin Tower! 2. Petaling Street 3. Batu Caves 4. A Hindu temple placed in Batu Caves 5. Little India Brickfields. I don‚Äôt remember the name of the restaurant, I just saw the place filled with people, and went for it. Had one of the customers look at me with a surprised face. Not sure if it was because I ordered so much food, or if I was eating it wrong. Either way I found it funny. 6. Botanical Garden, Kuala Lumpur. 7. A bird zoo inside the botanical garden. Ticket was kinda expensive, but I felt it was worth it. 8. An alleyway, can‚Äôt remember where. 9. Jalan Alor food street. It gets very busy, but easy to find a spot to eat. 10. Fruit stand near Jalan Alor, cheap prices! (Compared to where I am from) 11. Kuala Besut, near the jetty going to Perhentian Island. 12. Perhentian Island, a view from where I stayed (Villamas, great place for the price) 13. Some abandoned buildings along a hiking trail. The island I stayed in has hiking trails that covers most of the island, with several beaches, resorts and a fishing village on the trail. 14. A view on a boat I rode for snorkeling. The experience was great, with tons of colorful reefs and fishes (and sharks!), but almost threw up due to sea sickness. 15. Returning to Kuala Besut from the islands. From here I took an overnight bus to butterworth, a station right next to Penang Island. 16. Penang Island! A great place to just walk around and take in the view, and of course the food. 17. Lamb biryani in Restoran Kapitan. The place was so good I went again the following day 18. A cake cafe called Moody Cow. Tons of cakes that you can‚Äôt find elsewhere (Durian cake!). Kind of pricey, but the portion size is HUGE. The cafe entrance is kind of hidden behind vines, and is very moody inside (hence the name I guess). 19. Hokkien Shrimp Mee for breakfast, near Chowrasta Market. Broth had a very satisfying shrimp-y savory taste. 20. Bah Kuh Teh at Weh Hua Bak Kuh Teh, placed a street next to Chew Jetty. The vegetables topped with pork floss were so good, and the yam rice, dipping the fried dough into the soup‚Ä¶ I wish to eat this again. And theres so much more places, food I had that aren‚Äôt shown due to the image count limit (Ie, Nasi Kandar at hameediyah). Wish I could show it all. And I wish to return to this country again one day. But for now, I need to think of my next destination.

Perhentian island had higher food prices though, except the fisherman village, which is where all the locals live. For berths, a chalet at the island was $110 for 2 nights, while other places were around ~$15-20 a night (mix of dorms and single bedrooms).

1l9e0es,"Hi everyone, üòä Thanks for the advice I received in the past few days. It really helped me structure a rough 3-week itinerary in Malaysia, and I'd like to get some final feedback and suggestions. ## Travel plan (flexible) - **August 19**: arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the evening - **August 20‚Äì26**: flight to Borneo, staying in the Sabah region - **August 27**: return to Kuala Lumpur - **August 28 ‚Äì September 2**: transfer to the east coast, with base on the Perhentian Islands for environmental volunteering and relaxing - **September 3‚Äì6**: last few days to be defined, either on the east coast or back in Kuala Lumpur - **September 6/7**: return flight ## Details Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, I'm considering whether to: - stay one night to rest and fly to Borneo the next day, or - take a domestic flight to Borneo directly the same night In Borneo, I‚Äôm planning to spend around 5‚Äì7 days in the **Sabah region**. I‚Äôve read that it offers interesting experiences in nature, tropical islands, jungle, and biodiversity-related activities, but I haven‚Äôt decided yet what to include. After Borneo, I‚Äôd head to the east coast, focusing on the **Perhentian Islands**. I found an environmental volunteering opportunity there and would like to spend as much time as possible. The final days are open depending on connections and your suggestions. ## Questions 1. Is the Sabah region safe? 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mxc0nna,"Malaysian here, hope you find these answers helpful. 1. Is the Sabah region safe? Generally safe. You'll find some travel advisories regarding the east coast of Sabah which used to be targeted for pirate kidnappings. Authorities have kept it under control recently but something to keep in mind. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? Lots to do in Sabah such as the Sepilok Orangutan reserve, Kota Kinabalu town, Mabul & Sipadan islands for diving, Mount Kinabalu for hiking. The problem is transportation between them which I'll get to later. 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? It seems you are going for a nature themed trip which will generally be more authentic than going to urban areas. 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? It is difficult to get around the areas of your interest, East Peninsula and especially Sabah. There are no trains or public transport. Roads are very bad in Sabah. Your best bet would be buses but those are operated by private companies and you'll want to vet through carefully to make sure they are legit. Driving or motorbike on your own at your own risk, as mentioned the roads are bad. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? I would suggest you consider Sarawak. It is more developed than Sabah but also offers a lot in terms of nature, though mostly forest based vs island based. Would be much easier to arrange transport around Sarawak. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Redang Island is a boat ride from Perhentian. Tioman is further but also noteworthy. On the mainland there are the towns of Kuala Terengganu and Kuantan. Lake Kenyir also for an inland forest reserve. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? For just a day, I'd recommend staying near the airport. Not much to do in just a day in KL and it is quite a distance from the airport. The airport train is convenient though expensive, might want to see if you feel it is worthwhile to stay in the city based on that.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mxbz5tg,"I'd be inclined to push through and get to Sabah day 1. Flights go pretty late to Kota Kinabalu from KL so if you can tie up that flight with your inbound international flight, you should get there that night. Better to wake up in the destination than in some shitty airport hotel (KL city is a fair way from the airport). Otherwise, if you spend a couple of days/nights it would be worth it. You could split your KL stay at two ends of your trip, but I prefer to stay in one spot longer than to split it up.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

No, tourists were mainly locals. In some spots, like Sepilok, you encounter foreigners, but otherwise, very local crowd. 4. We rented a car. Cannot imagine local transport 7. KL is great.

n0bi1h0,"I‚Äôm familiar with most regions of Malaysia, but will limit my comments to the Borneo portion of your trip. Borneo is generally safe and yet to become overly touristed. It is quite a large island though, and occupied by 3 different nations. Infrastructure is not as developed as in West Malaysia, but that‚Äôs part of the charm. Given your tight schedule, I‚Äôd recommend limiting your explorations to Sabah only. This will provide you with the greatest variety of experiences to choose from, while minimizing travel time. In all likelihood, you‚Äôll arrive via a flight to KK (Kota Kinabalu). There are some gorgeous islands nearby that you can access via local boat (just be sure to note last returning boat‚Äôs time). There‚Äôs also a colorful night market in the city center. Within reasonable proximity is Mt Kinabalu, which you can climb if you desire, or simply hike in the area. You can get there on your own via bus, or take an organized day trip. If you‚Äôre keen on climbing, be prepared for much colder temperatures near the summit. Traveling by bus is slow, so to save time you could fly from KK to Sandakan. From there you could sign on (do this in advance) for a multi-day trip into the jungle along the Kinabatangan River, where you‚Äôll have a chance to spot elusive Proboscis Monkeys, Malaysian Sun Bears and Orangutans and Pygmy Elephants (the latter two not likely), and stay overnight in basic river lodges. Later, you may also wish to visit the Sepilok Orangutan and Sun Bear Rehab Centers (across the road from each other) near Sandakan. Another option from Sandakan would be be a small boat trip over rough seas to Turtle Island for an overnight and a chance to witness baby turtles hatching. If you do take this journey, don‚Äôt be spooked by armed Malaysian soldiers on the island. At this point you‚Äôll be near the Philippines‚Äô Sulu Archipelago, from which insurrectionists have been known to hail. If jungle adventures and choppy waters are not your speed, you could fly from Sandakan to Semporna (sometimes referred to as Malaysia‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Indonesia‚Äù due to the local immigrant population), and bask on the idyllic white sand beach.

I understand exactly what you mean - while I didn't feel in danger, exactly, I felt WAY better when I was traveling with a man than when I did my solo weekend trips around the country. I dressed very modestly (ie, pants and long sleeves every day) and still felt like I was getting stares all the time, some cat calling, and random men asking me to take photos with them. I didn't run into any super scary situations, but definitely felt uncomfortable on the regular in Malaysia and probably wouldn't go back, especially not solo. I basically avoided walking around on my own because of the weird vibes I was getting on the street, especially after dark. I did have one weird moment in the hotel I was staying at near Bukit Bintang - I was taking the elevator downstairs alone and two men got in. When we got to my floor, they sort of boxed me in and I had to push my way out to get out of the elevator. All in all, it was a weird experience because in some ways I felt ignored because I was a woman (ie, waiters only addressing my boyfriend, even when I was the one paying), and then in other cases I felt like I was harassed for being a woman. I somehow found my Malaysia experience to be better in Georgetown - maybe it's just a smaller and more densely concentrated tourist area, but people felt friendlier there overall and I felt more comfortable going out to night markets and tourist attractions whether or not my boyfriend could join.

If you arrive earlier, the local bus also stops in Terminal Sg Nibong. Go check RapidPenang route / schedule. 3) ETS train can be sold out really quick, make sure you book ahead.

mvuz0ug,"I was just there in March. I really loved Borneo and wish I allocated more time. Did not care for Taman Negara. Liked the Cameron Highlands a lot (just don't go on the weekends). Taman Negara was perhaps the biggest disappointment. I had 2 nights there, and by the morning after the first, I was plotting how I could cut out early to the next destination. Here's the thing about Taman Negara... the canopy walk has been closed for a while now, and will probably remain that way for a while. Other than that, a lot of the treks are similar, and you won't see much wildlife. The night tour was OK, but this is definitely not off the beaten path. If you want to leave the crowds behind, you have to commit yourself to a guided (i.e., pricey), uncomfortable, leach-filled, overnight trek. Cameron Highlands pleasantly surprised me. Yes, it's built up. Yes, it's touristy. But the scenery is spectacular, and there are multiple trekking opportunities. Keep in mind, the estimated times you see are grossly underestimated. In spite of the fact that development is encroaching on the trails, some of them are true jungle treks -muddy, difficult, and extremely steep (as in, more of a climb than a trek). Borneo is where you can really leave the crowds behind, and find those clean seas and crowd-free jungle treks where you can actually see animals. Mind you, I barely scratched the surface. But I'll say this, even a day trip to Bako National Park is extremely worth-while, where you'll have an excellent chance to see bearded pigs, proboscis monkeys, and of course spectacular scenery. Overnight is even better. I did Mt. Kinabalu, including the highest via ferrata in the world, and that was without a doubt one of the highlights (if not the highlight) of the trip. But very expensive. Did not even get to other spectacular scenery like Gunung Mulu NP. Kuching is a great town to base yourself in Borneo. Nearby you'll have access to national parks, a sanctuary of semi-wild orangutans, several local villages, and a delightful waterfront that serves as a promenade for locals. I haven't mentioned the cities so much, because you seem to not like cities as much. But I really liked the canopy walk on Penang Hill. Not crowded at all when I went, but it was a weekday on Ramadan, so YMMV. I got to see the cat-sized black giant squirrels as well as the furby-faced langurs.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

I will probably look to mix between flights and public transportation to go between cities. Recommendations on this welcome. I would love to have your help and advice with: * Where am I spending too long? * What am I missing that I should see? * Should I re-order any of the cities for better efficiency? * What's the best way to get between these cities? * Any other helpful advice you may have for me!

luhk53s,"Excited for your travels! A few notes: 1. 4 nights in Chiang Rai is a lot. I don‚Äôt particularly feel there‚Äôs much there. Maybe a day or two but four days feels like too much! Alternatively, you could also from Chiang Mai do a day trip into Chiang Rai - I did this with a tour off Get Your Guide and we left early in the morning, visited the main three temples in CR, then came back in the evening. But also, it makes sense to add CR as a stopping place if you‚Äôre doing the slow boat into Laos! 2. I absolutely love Chiang Mai but gosh, 8 days is a lot. I think it would be better to adjust to 4-5 days, it‚Äôs already a slow, peaceful town and 8 days seems like it would be boring fast (as someone who has visited Chiang Mai 3 times now). 3. 7 nights in Phuket also feels like a lot. I would adjust this to 3-5. I saw in a comment you said you enjoy a slower travel pace but 7 days in Phuket, even with its best sites, is still a pretty big tourist trap town. 4. I also think 5 days in KL is a bit much but changing to 3-4 days instead of 5 doesn‚Äôt seem like too much of a difference in the grand scheme of things. If you haven‚Äôt already, I‚Äôd maybe do more research into the towns you‚Äôre spending longer in to see what you‚Äôre interested in doing and how many days you want to spend doing them, because some of them feel excessively long (but I get everyone is different and enjoys different things).",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

Definitely shouldn't miss out the temples.

Bookings for transport from city to city (or even cross country) is available at almost every accommodation in these countries. If not, they know a reliable agency for sure that they'd be happy to share with you. From my personal experience, busses and land transportation is the best option as again, felt like flying took away some experience. It's nice to see what borders are like in different countries.

mxby7nc,"I spent almost all of my two-week Malaysia trip in Borneo! The Sabah travel advisories mostly focus on specific islands off the east coast of Sabah where there have been some security incidents in the past targeting tourists. So if in doubt you could avoid those islands. The Sabah portion of my trip was spent in Sandakan (as a base for a tour of Kinabatangan River area) and Kota Kinabalu (as a stopover before heading to Mulu National Park). Sandakan and KK are kind of odd cities in and of themselves but they don't feel particularly touristy, at least not the areas I stayed in. For seeing the Kinabatangan River area (and/or nearby-ish Danum Valley) you pretty much need to join a guided tour group since these areas are somewhat remote/wild, and the guides can find the wildlife. I saw three wild orangutans! Getting around in Borneo can be a bit impractical. On a tight schedule domestic flights unfortunately are the most reasonable option, or sometimes the *only* option. From Kota Kinabalu you could hike Mount Kinabalu if you want to. I'd have done that if I had more time. It sounds kinda intense though and is an overnight commitment. But if you like hiking it sounds probably worth it! I think there are some islands near-ish KK that you could visit and they're I think pretty far from any of the islands covered under some of the eastern Sabah travel advisories. If you add anything else to a Borneo itinerary, it might be worth considering Mulu National Park - it's more conventionally ""touristy"" in some ways but the massive caves there are unlike anything I've seen anywhere else. Deer Cave is, I think by most measures, the largest cave in the world. I stayed a night in KL after arriving and was glad I did. For a major city I thought it had a kind of relaxing ""vibe"" and great food, and I was grateful to not need to immediately get on another plane after arriving in the country.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mxgd31i,"1. Is the Sabah region safe? There are some tourist areas within areas with poorer folk, but like any other tourist place just exercise caution with beggars and pickpockets. But it is generally safe. If you aare referring to terrorist activities, this was around 10 years ago and there hasn't been tourist related threats since. Although you'll still see some armed personnel on beaches and islands here and there. But overall it's generally safe for tourists. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? From Kota Kinabalu, go to Mt Kinabalu. It is incredibly expensive to do the 2D1N climb up due to quotas but you can still do a day trip hike around the base of the mountain from Kota Kinabalu. Alternatively you can also stay in the nearby Kundasang area (beautiful views) but it is difficult to get around without a car. From there you have some alternatives. Alternative 1 - Fly or take the bus to Sandakan. Do the 3D/2N or 4D/3N Kinabatangan cruise + Sepilok orang utan centre. Sightings of wildlife at Kinabatangan are not guaranteed so most people do 3D2N but you can still absolutely do a 2D1N trip. Then you can try to squeeze in the second alternative if you'd like. Alternative 2 - Fly or take the bus to Tawau. Then take the van to Semporna. Do the 3D2N or 4D3N island hopping hikes and dives. The main attraction is Sipadan but just like Mt Kinabalu, it is also expensive to do it due to quotas. However there are many other islands and dive spots around that are just as gorgeous. You can fly from Tawau to Kuala Lumpur. 3. it too touristy or still authentic? Yes there are lots of tourists especially Chinese, Japanese and Koreans. But it's popular because it's gorgeous (and is a known vacation spot for East Asian celebrities). 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? Grab is a ride hailing app that is used everywhere. Taxis are overpriced if you try to haggle in person but they are also on Grab and prices are more transparent there. Do not attempt to haggle with a Malaysian taxi driver, they can get aggressive. Bike and car rentals are available everywhere. There are no motorbike taxis in Malaysia. For buses, download the Easybook or Redbus app. They are mostly used in Malaysia and prices are the same as in the bus stations unlike 12goasia. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? If you have just 1 week, stick to Sabah. If you have 2 weeks, you can do Sarawak as well. If you have 3-4 weeks, then you can consider Kalimantan. I've backpacked the entire island by land except when entering Brunei, feel free to ask me anything. You might want to check out the relevant subreddits r/Sarawak and r/Sabah. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Pulau Tioman and Pulau Redang are also popular but you won't have time to fit this in your current itinerary. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? If you've never been, KL is a cool place to check out for the night, especially if you love skyscrapers. KLCC Twin towers have a nice park (and are an icon of Malaysia) and the TRX is a magnificent tower. The food in Kuala Lumpur is also underrated compared to neighbouring capital cities. If you're not a fan of big cities and malls, definitely skip. The flight from KL to Kota Kinabalu is only a couple of hours anyway so it's not too bad.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

I'd personally not spend tons of time there after Perhentian. I'd add visiting the Cameron Highlands. 7. Depends how long your flight in was. I'd not take a flight after a 24hr commute (that's about how long it takes me to get to KL) I've collectively have probably spent 2 years of my life in Malaysia. Spent a few months in Borneo.

The only other addition I would make to these suggestions would be Sipadan out of Semporna if you dive. I would check the weather and season's impact on the visibility first. It is a short drive away from shore and the biomass is staggering (huge schools). There were incidents with Sulu pirates there but that has been ages and ages ago now.

1lijz39,"Hi everyone. I (21M) am headed to Malaysia next month for a short solo trip before my birthday. It's my first solo trip so I'm super lost right now and would love some guidance and input! It's an 11 day trip from 31 July to 10 August. Right now I am sort of indecisive on the itinerary because as it's my first time traveling solo and 2nd time traveling in a foreign country in general, I'm not sure if my itinerary is too packed or rushed. I'm looking for a good mix of exploration, nature, fun stuff(!!) and just relaxation. Here's what the plan is for now (my ""thoughts"" are written in Italics for the sake of clarification): # Days 1-4 (31/7 - 3/8): Kuala Lumpur * Day 1: Land in KL around 4 PM, get to hotel, freshen up etc by 6-7 PM, go out and explore. I'm thinking of booking a hotel in Bukit Bintang area so I can explore the area on day 1 and perhaps visit a few markets? * Day 2: Batu Caves half day tour + Sunway Lagoon(?) + Central Market at night * Day 3: Petronas Twin Towers + Putrajaya + Chow Kit (idk much about this but my friend suggested I visit) + National Mosque + Rex KL + Genting Highlands (??) * Day 4: *Now I'm not sure if I should stay in KL for day 4 or do a day trip elsewhere. If days 1-3 are too packed, I can spread some stuff out and move it to day 4. But if they're ok I can do a day trip somewhere on day 4 instead?* # Day 5 (4/8): Cameron Highlands * *I'm thinking of going on a day trip to Cameron Highlands on day 5. Initially I wanted to stay in CH overnight but I really want to visit Ipoh as well so I thought maybe I should do 2 day trips to both places rather than an overnight one in CH alone.* * *BUT as day 4 (3/8) is kinda free should I just move CH back one day? And then this will allow me to extend my stay in Langkawi later on in the trip? Or should I change CH to overnight from 3/8-4/8 and keep my stay in Langkawi (later in the trip) as it is?* * I'm thinking of joining an affordable tour for CH, even better if it leaves from KL. Any recommendations would be appreciated! :) # Day 6 (5/8): Ipoh * Bus from CH to Ipoh * *I know that I want to spend a day in Ipoh, but I don't really have any specific spots or activities in mind, so I was wondering which spots you guys think I should visit in Ipoh and/or any activities I can do there.* * *Again, like I said before, if I'm not doing anything in KL, I will either: (a) push everything a day back, so this trip to Ipoh will be taking place on 4/8; or (b) stay overnight in CH and this trip will take place on 5/8 as planned.* # Days 7-8 (6/7 - 7/8): Penang * Train + Car Ferry from Ipoh to Penang * *I don't have the exact day to day itinerary planned because I'm not sure how to spread out the different places I wanna visit in Penang, but I'd love to go to the following spots:* * Penang Hill * Batu Ferringhi * Georgetown (would love some recs for must do things here!) * Cheong Fat Tsz Mansion * Clan Jetties of Penang * ESCAPE (I'm indecisive about this one because I'm already going to Sunway Lagoon in KL. For those who have been to ESCAPE, would you recommend this spot? # Days 9-10 (8/7 - 9/8): Langkawi * Flight from Penang to Langkawi (?) Because I think the ferry got discontinued so flight is my only option? * *I don't have any specific spots for Langkawi, but my main aim is to just relax and maybe chill at the beach, walk around the markets that I've heard about in a few travel vlogs. I would really appreciate if you guys could recommend specific spots for Langkawi.* * *Also, echoing what I mentioned before about KL's day 4, do you guys think I should scratch off day 4 from KL and instead use that day in Langkawi, staying here for 3 days rather than just 2 days?* * 9/8 9:00 PM Flight from Langkawi to KL # Days 11: KL but not really * I'll reach KL at around 10:30 ish PM on 9/8, and my flight back to Hong Kong is the next morning at 7 AM. * *I know this probably sounds dumb, I could've booked a flight from Langkawi to HK but the flights I checked all had really long layovers in KL and none of them would bring me back to HK on Sunday night. I can't come back to Monday as I sadly will have to resume work that day, and I thought this would be a better option.* * Help: So since I will reach KL at around 10:30 but my flight to HK isn't until 7 AM the next morning, should/can I stay overnight at the airport lounge or should I just book a hotel for that night? Is the itinerary too packed or just fine? Plus should I take any places out, move anything around etc? Any suggestions are highly welcome because the only things finalized right now are my flights (had to book them in advance for my visa application), but I can still make some tweaks to my itinerary.

Yeah, they drive on the wrong side of the road, but it's really not so bad compared to other parts of SEA. Train sounds nice but it will give you way more flexibility, especially going to CH, which is very worthwhile. Three days is enough for KL, but only just. But your Day 3 looks impossibly packed. Putrajaya will be at least a half day in and of itself. Go to Batu caves by train and just do it on your own. Go early AM so that the stairs are still in shade and you don't roast completely. Go to one of the rooftop bars, starting before sunset and stay till the lights go on -amazing pictures can be had. My favorite was Satellite- less well known than some others, but that's a good thing. Superb views of Petronas towers. But the best part of KL is the food. After three days, you will not feel FOMO about missing any sights, but you will feel serious FOMO that you only had 6 lunches and dinners to choose from. Research and choose wisely. You really do want to spend that overnight in CH, especially if you want to do more than see a couple of tea plantation overlooks... like go to Flora Park or do some trekking. But make sure NOT to go on the weekend! Ipoh is worth one day, and that is including Kellie's Castle as well as some of the cave temples around Ipoh. I found these sights more worthwhile than Ipoh itself, and all of these are best reached with a car. Penang is worth at least two days. The premier sight there is Penang Hill, which you want to see on a day when there are few people, late afternoon is best, and take the canopy walk \*slowly\*. Much more likely to be rewarded with animal sightings that way. Kek Lok Si temple is very impressive. Blue Mansion is nice too, but if you see just one Mansion in George Town, make it the Green Mansion. TOP Penang has amazing views from the rooftop bar, but do NOT sign up for the pricey skywalk. Just tell them you want to go to the bar, go up there for free, get a drink, and stand right next to the tiny skywalk and get the same exact views. But most of all Penang is again about the food. Don't know if I would go so far, but some say it's even better than KL. Haven't been to Langkawi, but from what I've read, it can be squeezed in if you fly. But I would just fly back out of there.

mpziz7q,"I did a similar route as a solo female traveler except i had a bit more time plus I added Vietnam on the list! Chiang Mai is north thailand, and beaches are usually around south thailand. You might get tired with all of the traveling you‚Äôre going to do especially within that time frame. For Malaysia, if you‚Äôre only staying at KL, 1-2 nights is enough time to spend in the city. I think a great route would be to start with North Thailand, BKK, then Phuket/ Krabi, and maybe one of the islands nearby if you have a bit more time (Koh Phi Phi, Koh Lanta). You can then flyover to Malaysia and explore KL for 1-2 days, then headover to Indonesia. Wishing you the best time in your travels!",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mpzvx0p,Get vaccinated before you go and you should be mostly fine. I did 3 countries in 3 weeks and it was fine. Travelling solo makes your more efficient. You can fly quite cheaply inside of asia with the budget airlines. Most important enjoy and have fun!,positive,positive,0.9832,positive,0.9998
mq2jyz4,"All three would be really tight. Getting into and out of Indonesia can be a pain and somewhat expensive. A couple of points. >I definitely want to do chiang mai/pai area for the ethical elephant sanctuaries and a cooking class, Northern Thailand is really interesting and definitely worth a visit. Assuming that you will land in Bangkok, I suggest flying to Chiang mai to save a day of travel. In my opinion, Elephant sanctuaries are a little overrated. Its basically a petting zoo featuring elephants. Its pretty interesting and fun to see elephants up close, but its not like you are trekking through a jungle to ""save"" the elephants. As far as cooking classes, there are plenty of classes available all over the place and to be honest, its more like something to do during a break in your travel rather than travelling specifically to do a cooking class. There is plenty of other things to see and do. >a bit of the beaches in Thailand of course, I am going to assume you are talking about Southern Thailand islands/beaches (Phi Phi, Phangan, Samui etc). They are beautiful, but it is VERY far from Northern Thailand and Bangkok. Flights from Chiang Mai to Phuket would be your best option to save time. Otherwise its about 2 days + journey by train/bus. Getting around southern thailand will also take time, distances are farther than they look on the map. >and then an orangutan jungle trek in Indonesia! Same for the orangutans in Indonesia (I am going to assume you are looking into Sumatra). Depending on how you want to do it, it ranges from ""real"" jungle treks to just a big zoo with orangutans. The real treks are quite strenuous and can be pretty pricey. Also, the real treks take up a quite of bit of time, getting to Medan, getting to Bukit Lawang, and the trek itself and then back out again. 4 to 5 days and it will be pretty rushed. A more reasonable pace would probably be a week or so. >Planning on using Malaysia more as a 3-5 days passover spot in between the other 2 countries. It seems like a lot of flights. Your home country to Bangkok to Chiang Mai to Phuket to Kuala Lumpur to Medan back to Kuala Lumpur and then back home? Basically 3 weeks is VERY tight schedule. For a nice pace, instead of cramming everything in, i would suggest passing on Indonesia and sticking to Thailand and Malaysia. You will not regret it. >Also, I feel like google is telling me some type of food poisoning is inevitable, Severe Food Poisoning, probably not, you will definitely experience travellers diarrhea. There are plenty of pharmacies available with western meds. >Seeing leeches, snakes, and some disease carrying mosquitoes when researching which is scaring me - so basically how big of concern is that? If you stay on the backpackers trail, almost zero concern. Honestly monkeys and crazy scooter drivers are probably a bigger nuisance than leeches or snakes.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mpytxmd,"I absolutely loved Chiang Mai and Pai, and you should definitely get out to the elephant sanctuary outside Chiang Mai! Tons of good night markets and food too, it's well worth doing a food tour. Bring some motion sickness pills for the bus ride up to Pai though! I did just want to say that as a 25F who was in Malaysia last year, the vibes felt entirely different when I was traveling solo there versus with my boyfriend, as much as I hate to say it - and this was in major tourist areas like KL and Melacca. I'd say I mostly felt really uncomfortable more than anything else - I didn't feel super unsafe per se, but I also wouldn't really want to wander around at night alone. Stuff like men overtly staring at me and taking photos of me as I walked by on the street, waiters and taxi drivers ignoring me completely and only addressing my boyfriend, etc. I had one scary moment where two men sort of boxed me into an elevator in my accommodation in KL as well. I've traveled all over Asia and the Pacific, both alone and with my boyfriend, used to locals wanting to take photos with me, ask me where I'm visiting from, etc, but Malaysia was really the only place I've experienced this and felt weird about it, despite dressing incredibly conservatively (ie long sleeve and pants all the time). I've also spent time in Muslim parts of Indo and haven't noticed the discrepancy in how females are treated like how I did in Malaysia. Really don't want to scare you with this, but having felt weird about my time there I figured it was worth sharing my experience!",positive,positive,0.996,positive,0.9979
mpzswjb,"The thing I may add though is that many of the beaches in Malaysia, and then especially on the eastcoast islands, like Perhentian or some of the smaller islands, are to my taste better than the ones in Thailand. If beaches is the thing in southern Thailand then Malaysia is just as good or even sometimes better. At those islands it's also compleatly diffrent from the mainland. Sooo many solo woman travellers there. Otherwise Sabah, which has a big chinese population are also less conservative and also has some orangutangs at least as it is on northern Borneo. Some places in Indonesia and Malaysia would be better to skip as a solo woman traveler but certainly not all parts of those countries. Indonesia is great but at least I think it would be very stressful to add Indonesia to the trip as the best parts are either in the very far east (at least if one likes corals), the Kalimantan (at least for Orangutangs) and Bali, if not Lombok, Flores and the Komodo, is even if beautiful and not bad for solo woman traveler both far away as the others and still just very touristy with beaches that can't compare with the best ones in Malaysia, Thailand or the Phillipines. Vietnam may be an option, but in the end, why are names of countries important? Is it to count countries you havebeen to or is it the experiences you'll get and places you'll see? There are plenty better options to see much diffrent things than just ruch around to countries quiet far from eachother.

mq0t60s,"hello from Kuala Lumpur, 3 days is actually more than enough to explore the city of KL, if you're bored, go for a day trip to Malacca, or Cameron Highlands, or if you make friends, maybe go have fun at a nearby waterfall. public transportation is very convenient (only around KL unfortunately but its enough for tourist, get the day pass that is so cheap MYR5) Malaysians are super curious so its okay if you feel weird about them, but dont worry(we) they are harmless unless provoked. if you have more time, it is the time of the month where the best weather to go to the beautiful islands of Perhentian, Redang, Tioman etc. if you want to go to Borneo, go ti Sipadan or Mabul, or visit orang utan there.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mq1qyyv,"I‚Äôve just been to Malaysia and Thailand (Indonesia is the next stop) and it‚Äôs so doable! I‚Äôm not sure what your budget is like but I was not prepared for how expensive Thailand was and I had booked all accommodation well in advance so bear that in mind. However, buses within Thailand are relatively cheap so I would definitely opt for them instead of any internal flights. I preferred the north and personally felt the islands were a bit of a let down (reminded me of Brits abroad and seriously could‚Äôve been in Benidorm), if you‚Äôre short on time I would suggest beaching elsewhere. Research your hostels! If you‚Äôre not a huge drinker then don‚Äôt go for a party one. I‚Äôd also suggest booking tours through your hostels too as they‚Äôll most likely be cheaper than Viator etc. plus you‚Äôll be with people you‚Äôve already met. Malaysia was one of my favourite places I‚Äôve ever been and I would highly recommend going for longer than 5 days if possible. KL is an amazing city but there‚Äôs also so much more to see! Langkawi and Penang were incredible so if you can I would look in to going to both places. I‚Äôve been travelling since January and thankfully have not had food poisoning once! I would simply follow the rule of if there‚Äôs a queue you‚Äôre good. Leeches, snakes I haven‚Äôt seen either. Mosquitoes have been a daily occurrence (not sure on disease carrying) but stock up on local repellent and again, you‚Äôre good. If you‚Äôre staying in cheaper accommodations then be prepared for cockroaches and ants but both are harmless ü•≤ I‚Äôd really suggest not planning everything down to a T but whatever you do will be an amazing experience and you won‚Äôt regret it! üòÄ",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mq5du3o,"I spent ten days on the Perhentian Islands in Malaysia. They are close to the Thai border. These islands are beautiful and if you are into the nature/safe adventure thing, they are perfect. Lots of snorkeling, SUP, swimming, jungle trekking. I wrote two blog articles about the Perhentians. Check them out. I will write some more but I work fulltime so I did not manage yet. For the Orangutan, consider Malaysia too, especially Borneo. I booked Borneo exactly for this reason for July. Will report back how it was, haha! Check Sandakan and Sepilok. They have the big orangutan centers there but they also offer a lot of jungle hikes to see them in the wild. I loved Java in Indonesia a lot. Here are some suggestions what to do in Java Btw, I am also a female solo traveler and I found both Malaysia and Indonesia very safe. I never had an issue. The men sometimes try it (why not?) but in a very polite way and accept a no much much faster than Western men. Both are mainly muslim countries. Respect their culture, dress appropriately. They are very tolerant towards tourists but locals appreciate it, if you dress modestly, means, cover knees and shoulders, not too much cleavage and just let the string bikini at home. It's better anyway to wear long and light clothing in tropical places. Protects of the sun and bugs. I did catch food poisoning once. No idea from where I got it. It was a miracle that I only had it once, given that I ate in very dodgy places. So far I only got a few mosquito bites that were a bit itchy. Again: cover up and use a spray in the jungle and after sunset. Enjoy the trip! Indonesians are the kindest and nicest ppl ever!

mqg6tvg,"Hi. I was traveling in Indonesia and Thailand last year. To clarify: 2 Months of Indonesia and 2 Months in Thailand. Your Plan sounds very nice, though I agree with others that u are on a tight schedule ^^. Just one thing to add: Check the weather!!!! Rain season (Monsun) is not just a lot of rain. It heavily impacts day to day life, for tourist and native. Sumatra for example experiences heavy flooding and earth slides from October through February. I was there last year in April and that was still very dangerous sometimes. Monsun will make it impossible to do Jungle tracks and see wildlife. Most tracks are even closed completely during rain season. U should be fine in North Thailand, though rain season is also commencing there, just not that heavily. I wouldn't recommend going to Indonesia earlier then February. After visiting over 30 countries in 4 years of solo traveling, Indonesia is my favorite one so far.

And finally fly to Chiang Mai for 6 days in Chiang Mai/Pai before heading home. Seems like there is a ton I will love in these 2 spots, but still I think just being near elephants is super cool.

mk6t86c,"Visited in June 2024. I think I got a bus from TBS IN KL to Jerantut. There is supposed.to be a minivan once daily from Jerantut to Taman Negara but I'm unclear about the exact time. Got in a private taxi for about 50-70RM? Was fine but the car was old and a little stuffy. You can book activities when you get there, there are 2 or 3 agencies that organise tours. It's a very small village, had like 4 restaurants that I can remember? I went on the Night Walk, Canopy Walk (both were priced per pax) and a boat tour (priced at per boat for 1-4 pax). Also did some short hikes by myself which was free, just register at the park office so they can record your visit.",positive,positive,0.9509,positive,1.0

If you want you can catch a ferry from Kuala Kedah to Langkawi which is sort of like the bali of malaysia. maybe one night there is enough and you can take the bus straight back to KL after. Been to melaka as well and i think its just a mini version of georgetown. There is so much to do and see in KL if you enjoy city and cultural stuff, its easy to catch or do random activities to do in KL. Other recommendations are Pulau Perhentian in Terengganu which might be a hassle to get to but the beaches are breathtaking, Kundasang in Sabah to see Mount Kinabalu.

Dates: - Landing in Kuala Lumpur at 12am on August 1 - Flying out at 12am on August 8 So I‚Äôve got a full 7 days on the ground Places I‚Äôd love to visit: - Kuala Lumpur - Genting Highlands (mainly for the theme park‚ÄîI‚Äôm a huge theme park fan!‚Äîand maybe some outlet shopping) - Cameron Highlands - Penang I‚Äôm into culture, local food, nature, and slow-ish travel‚Äînot trying to cram everything in, but I also want to make the most of the trip.

Also‚Äîrandom packing question: Is it better to bring just a backpack and buy a small luggage bag in KL for shopping/souvenirs? Or should I bring a small suitcase from the start?

Cameron Highlands to Penang is like 5h. From Penang to KL you can also take a bus or a train. The trains go from Butterworth, there's a regular ferry from Georgetown to Butterworth and vice versa.

I plan to begin from Penang, Georgetown, Cameron Highlands, KL, Malacca, Johor Bahru, and either end my trip in Singapore or detour to Kuching and end there. A bit about me: I‚Äôm travelling alone at age 17. This means I‚Äôm not yet considered to be an adult (and I know I can only stay in Airbnb and hostels but not in hotels during the trip due to my age). I‚Äôve traveled solo before (to Hong Kong), so I have some experience, but I still want to make sure I stay safe on this trip. I might not want to go too deep into the wild and do too much of hiking or diving this time, but I would definitely love to save those experiences to my future trips. I am more interested in the cultural stuff, beaches, and some mild nature vibe this time. I prefer public transportation to move from place to place. I also want to slow down my pace and stay in a place for longer. Also, I have already been to Singapore before with my family, so if I finally decide to end my trip in Singapore, it would only be a one day or half day stay so it won‚Äôt take much time. My questions: 1. Are there any important things I should know about traveling alone in Malaysia at 17? Are there any age-related restrictions I should be aware of? 2. Should I consider removing any places to give myself more flexibility? Is Johor Bahru worth visiting? I don‚Äôt see many people mentioning this place. 3. Are there any other places in Malaysia that might fit my interests and are not included in my plan yet? 4. Any other advice you wanna give me! Thx!!",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

Food: i recommend ordering a bunch of stuff to try at any big enough food centre (maxwell, bukit timah interim food centre, bedok 85 market if you're curious about local residential areas). Pizza: goldenroy; dim sum: Swee Choon, both at Jalan Besar, which is a pretty nice area for local vibes too. Nature: east coast park, you can rent a bike and cycle all the way to marina bay. Marina barrage on a windy night is amazing. Any reservoir: macritchie, lower peirce, bedok. Hike at tree top walk, bukit timah rail corridor, bukit timah hill, etc., you can see trails on google maps / nparks website. There's also coney island, pulau ubin. Education: national gallery (plenty of seats to chill too), lee kong chian natural history museum (at NUS), lee kong chian reference library. Bird paradise.

MY (just been back from a solo visiting Malacca, KL, Ipoh, Penang) Malacca: good place to try nonya/peranakan food. Personally think that 1 night will be sufficient. KL: must visit ICC Pudu - they got some good selection of food stuff! Try Bun Choon egg tart, and a stall selling chicken baos. I also highly recommend Batu caves.

I have been on multiple trips lasting from a few weeks to a few years. Mostly solo and more on a chill pace. With that, I learned early on having a plan is nice, but I was never even remotely able to keep that plan. I was spontaneous and followed other travellers recommendations, when I had the feeling we share the same mindset. Hence, I completely gave up on planning entirely. That's for the background, now on to my very privileged problem. Yesterday, I arrived in Kuala Lumpur and I will be flying out of KL in about 3.5 weeks. I have no idea where to go and what to do. I specifically don't know where I should spend new years. I would like to hava a social chill place for NYE, not much of a big party. Do any of you know of a place? Based on that I think I could work out a rough itinerary. I was thinking about - Ipoh 1-2 days, - Penang 3-5 days, - Langkawi 3-5 days.

m2hq1hs,"I guess that depends on what you like to do! Do you want partying, history, nature, beaches, culture, socializing...? **Kuala Lumpur** is very urban. It has a little bit of history, but it's mainly for nightlife, shopping, partying. If you're looking for glamour and instagram pictures, take KL. **Ipoh** is an industrial city. It's trying to establish itself as a ""hidden gem"" now, but it's still a bit rough. But that has its charm, if you're the type that likes to look behind the stage. Also, lots of pretty temples. **Penang** is the hip city. Multicultural, fusion food, street art, you know. Good place if you enjoy socializing or feel you have an artist's soul. They have some beaches and temples and those are nice, but most people just go for the general vibe. **Langkawi** is tropical resorts. Same applies to **Koh Lipe,** or the **Perhentian** islands (on the other side of the country): beaches, palm trees, sun, sea. Langkawi has the advantage over the other two that it's a pretty big island, so there are more adventurous activities (waterfalls, mountains, mangroves) to be found if you get bored of the beach. **Malacca** is somewhat similar to Penang, but it focuses a bit more on (old) history than on contemporary culture. Colonial architecture, forts, good food. **Cameron Highlands** are mainly nice because of how different they are to the rest of the country, suddenly going from hot and palm plantations to cold and evergreens. Very touristy, though (and more older tourists or families). Good for a day trip to see the tea, or for longer if you just want to relax, maybe hike a bit. Definitely not an ""active"" social spot. You didn't mention **Taman Negara**, which is the closest you'll get to wild nature. Even there it's a sanitized version of nature (you won't be allowed to go far from the entrance), unless you go on a multi-day tour. It's still pretty cool, but maybe the middle of the jungle is not the best place to spend NYE.

Great food and unique colonial architecture. Lots of temples, mosques, and churches to visit. A cute and very walkable place. Singapore: 3 nights. This wasn't part of my original loose plan, but by chance an old friend was there. 3 nights for me in SG was probably enough, but I'm glad I went and got to experience it. Its more expensive than Malaysia. Cameron Highlands: 3 nights. Very scenic with hiking, big views and tea plantations. I liked the slow pace, sociable hostels, and cooler temperatures Ipoh: 1 night. The food markets were good and it was nice to visit somewhere less touristy. I didn't visit any temples so one night was plenty for me. Agree with another poster that it was quite industrial. The bus station is outside the city so factor this in. Georgetown: c5 nights. At this point I specifically wanted to stay longer somewhere longer, plus it was lunar new year. Brilliant food, temples interesting architecture, and plenty to see and do for several nights at a slow pace, I didn't visit beaches. If I'd not gone to SG I was going to go to Taman Negara and I regret that I didn't get the chance to go.

Here is my list: **üáªüá≥ Da Nang ‚Äì 9.5/10** * Growing digital nomad community * Very affordable * Beautiful beach and chill vibes * More English speakers than other Vietnamese cities * Grab bikes come within 5 minutes; very quick to travel between areas * Ideal weather is in winter * good air quality. * Felt very safe * I heard summer is very hot and humid but the beaches are swimmable. In winter you can't swim * The best massages and very affordable * Very limited nightlife, kinda ghost town at midnight * Mostly just Vietnamese and Korean food options * Probably the kindest people I‚Äôve met in SEA * Very close to Hoi An **üá≤üáæ Penang ‚Äì 9/10** * Rich in culture and heritage * Beautiful beaches and near scenic islands * Weather is hot af during the day but evenings are nice * Humidity was bearable * Good air quality * Safe city * Beaches stay full of people at night and they always have some fun activities * Not much to do if you wanna party * Feels family oriented; this could be either good or bad * Well-developed infrastructure * Food heaven: Indian, Chinese, and Arabic * Slightly pricey for long stays over a month $$$ **üá≤üáæ Kuala Lumpur (KL) ‚Äì 7.5/10** * Very modern and well-connected * Most people speak English * Great food variety * Pricy for long stays * Very diverse city; sometimes people thought I'm local * Advanced healthcare * Hard to find decent apartments that isn't moldy or has humidity issues * Malls everywhere * Gyms are very expensive for some reason * Okay nightlife, nothing crazy and alcohol is expensive * Malaysian, Chinese, Indian, western, Middle Eastern food options. The Malaysian food is the cheapest but usually fried and oily. * Didn't need to worry much about haggling * Train that connects most hotspots; I mostly used it over Grab * Easy to meet people and young professionals * Downsides: super humid, chaotic energy, not much chill space, not walkable city * Also the only city where I experienced racism or hostility in customer service situations, happened more than once. **üáπüá≠ Bangkok ‚Äì 8/10** * Never boring, nightlife and entertainment 24/7 * Great food scene (local + Western) * Cool roof bars * Thai massages everywhere, but I still prefer the Vietnamese oil massages * There are many tourists and the city is too crowded everywhere * Diverse city: China town, Korean town (Sukhumvit Plaza), Soi Arab. * Easy to meet new people or go on dates because there are many solo travellers * English was not an issue * Super humid and hot even at night; I showered 3 times every day * Bad traffic if you use Grab but they got a train * Need to know how and when to haggle. Best to book things online. * The best malls * Scams here and there, gotta watch out if you are alone * Need to watch out for your valuable items if you go clubbing or bars * Worst air pollution on this list * Healthcare is good * Affordable massages and personal care (Spa, skincare, etc) * A fun place short-term but I wouldn't stay long **üáªüá≥ Hanoi ‚Äì 6.5/10** * Culturally rich and close to stunning nature * City itself isn‚Äôt super developed * Lots of touristy attractions to explore solo or with group tours (very affordable) * Sidewalks are taken over by motorbikes and crossing the streets ain't fun, least walkable city I ever been to * Easy to meet new people but hard to make friends due to language barrier and most travellers just stay a few days and leave * Not the cleanest streets but the shops are mostly clean and nice from inside * Bad air quality, I wore a face mask * Dating apps full of scammers and sex workers based on quick glance and stories I read * Food, especially meat from street food, is not always clean... all my homies got food poisoning * Very few English speakers * Got overrun with disrespectful tourists (loud party people, Karens, etc.) * Very Affordable * Amazing nature if you explore the country side * Great nightlife * Peak cafes * Very limited food options, if you wanna something else other than Vietnamese",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

Digital nomads aren't exactly the most attractive tenants, since they'll be staying in Malaysia for a **maximum** of 12 months, which is what the country's digital nomad visa allows them.

Secondly, the Malaysian government approved only 2,000 digital nomad visas between 2022 and 2024 (out of 4,000 applications). \[1\] That implies 1,000 digital nomads a year. You talk about ""taking a building with 200-300 apartments"", suggesting you want to grab 20-30% of Malaysia's entire share of digital nomads. How likely is that, given that digital nomads will likely be spread throughout Malaysia rather than concentrated in Johor state? Thirdly, Forest City is a ghost town targeted at Chinese customers. Sure, there are groceries on site, but it's going to be Chinese-oriented, which isn't going to appeal to every digital nomad.

I'm not saying it doesn't exist, it's just way more nuanced than people are letting on here. They kind of sound like they heard about someone's bad experience and have generalized their impression of Malaysia to be like apartheid South Africa or something. It's not. I've also lived in Canada for 5 years, and the discrimination I experienced there was much worse than anything I've experienced in Malaysia. There are also a ton of foreigners in KL from South Asia, China, the rest of ASEAN, and Africa. You'll see those groups stick together often, but then, why wouldn't they? Like is there an expectation that they're supposed to all act out those scenes from ""diverse college ads"" or something? I do admit that Malaysian landlords have a despicable tendency to ask about race, but that's easily avoided if you go through AirBnb and that sort of thing. If you're renting in KL, like close to downtown, I highly doubt they ask about race. It depends on the neighbourhood. Then again, all of this is subjective, and it very much depends on area and social class. The more upper class, the more you start seeing different races mixing together. It's the middle and lower classes where there's more division. And obviously, the more suburban, or the more rural you get, the more obvious it might be too. But you're talking about KL, so. I think KL is well liked by many people, especially older travellers (30s and above) and people with families, because it's more orderly and clean than other Southeast Asian cities except Singapore. It still has a dash of culture and chaos if you know where to look. It's very much a case of, if you want Michelin starred dining in some fancy revolving sky tower bullshit you can get it. If you want to eat street food made out of suspicious meat on a rat infested street where some guy is hollering about his religion's end times you can get that too. If you move to KL, you'll experience a higher and more globalized standard of living. But that may not be what you want.

It's the only place where I was asked what race I was when I was trying to rent a place. That was the kicker for me. As a woman I didn't feel that safe and I had to resort to my RBF, which I hate doing, especially coming from relaxed places like Thailand and Cambodia where men leave you alone. I like walking around and many times I find myself being the only non local. In KL once or twice I felt uncomfortable being the only woman amongst many men. I'm also petite, so that doesn't help. It's a good city, but I found it dull and I don't drink/use drugs/party, so imagine how dull it might be for someone who does. As a country Malaysia isn't as culturally open as it professes to be. A friend who's lived there for years told me what the Malays really think of the Chinese and the Indians and it's not good. In 6 weeks in Malaysia I only counted maybe 4 or 5 mixed race couples?

mg1yxkl,"G'day g'day! FULL disclosure, I haven‚Äôt personally relocated to Singapore, Malaysia, or the UAE. And I‚Äôm an Aussie. But! I AM a digital nomad interested in this space, and I'm currently writing a comprehensive 'Survival to Success guide for Nomads hailing from the most common countries nomads hail from - and Canada happens to be one of them. THe taxes, visas, and cost of living (COL) stuff is obviously a very important consideration for nomads, and the information I‚Äôll lay out here applies to you as a Candian, but... always DYOR! The visa and tax space is highly maleable because the digital nomad scene ius growing as people leave their country of origin in pursuit of locations more aligned with their values and their hip pockets. With this all disclosed, here's what I've found so far‚Ä¶ Singapore personal income tax is low relative to Canada‚Äôs. Progressive rates max out around 22%.. This said, most earners fall into much lower brackets and you should check your brackets to see how this will apply to you (obviously. Also, nevcer hurts to consult a tax specialist. Tax is tricky and it makes sense to check what your liabilities are). When in doubt, DYOR ! Cost of Living is high, particularly rent, which is one of the biggest problems for relocaters depending on your income. If you want to live in central areas, expect premium prices. Food can also get expensive if you rely on dining out in more Western-style places, but food/hawker stalls are affordable, as with a lot of Asian city locations. Work visas inj singapore like the employment pass are competitive, and Singapore has been tightening criteria lately, especially around minimum salaries. They seem to be hiring locals first, more and more, too, which may box out folks like yourself. There are some visa options for entrepreneurs, but they come with high income or investment requirements and the figures can be a bit offputting. Coudn‚Äôt tell you what they are off the top of my dome, though. Basically, Singapore doesn't seem like an especially friendly freelancer visa destination based on my research. Malaysia....Personal income tax ranges from 0%-30%, more or less. But expats with no Malaysian-sourced income can sometimes structure their affairs to limit taxes. Again, the cost to you in the long run if you see a tax specialist is high and well worth the investment. Heads up: foreign income is currently tax-exempt, though this could change. And it really could - the tax and visa situation for any given country is evolving really quickly, so continue to DYOR and stay abreast of changes. COL in Malyasia is way lower than in Singapore. Rent, food, transport are all relatively more affordable. Even in Kuala Lumpur you can find modern apartments for a fraction of what you‚Äôd pay in the West, which is enticing (to someone like me). Visa Process is easier compared to Singapore,too. Check out the my second home (MM2H) visa. It‚Äôs been revamped a few times recently, though, so again, stay abreast of its status relative to your intentions and circumstances. Also, if you‚Äôre working remotely for non-Malaysian clients, Malaysia is pretty digital nomad-friendly‚Ä¶ even though they don‚Äôt have an official DN visa yet. Work visas through employers exist, but they‚Äôre more for traditional employment, which may or may not fit your bill. UAE - the tax situation is one of the UAE‚Äôs biggest draws - 0% personal income tax for individuals. Some VAT (value added tax - get used to hearing this if you‚Äôre thinking of moving around a bit because it‚Äôs important!) applies to goods and services, but income itself is untaxed. I've been looking into this for myself, but cultutally I'm not sure it's what I'm looking for as a destination. COL in UAE varies massively based on how you choose to live and spend. Rent in Dubai and Abu Dhabi can be steep, but if you live in less central areas or neighboring emirates (like Sharjah), you can expect to save some coin. Groceries tend to be pricier, especially imported items (consider your favourite Canadian staples, say), but local food is reasonable. Re visas‚Ä¶the UAE seems to be trying to entice nomads with their nomad-friendly Remote Work Visa, which lets you live in Dubai while working for an overseas employer. They also offer freelance visas in soime sectors, like media, tech, design etc. You‚Äôd need to deep diove more to see whether this visa satisfies your circumstances, though. The visa process is fairly streamlined, compared to some countries, though there are fees! ‚Ä¶And there are defs some mandatory health insurance requirements you;d need to meet in order to be eligible. Hope this helps. And cheers for the prompted revision deep dive - it helps with the ebook! Happy DYOR-ing, and hit me up if you're interested in checking out my ebook when it becomes available!

That said, I found Singapore to be a much easier and more efficient place to operate from. Everything is in English, company incorporation takes just a few days, and annual filings are incredibly simple. Having a company in Singapore also allows you to apply for a work permit to manage your business (therefore local residency).

I would also like to ride a rented motorcycle, so it should be less crowded. Some other preferences: \-Preferably in the mountain,s but beaches also work as long as it's quiet \-The goal is to just live there and do my work but I would also like to explore on the weekends so if the place is big enough to be explored that would be good \-Something not in the main city, basically in an area where I can go out to walk, observe the views, stuff like that. \-Reason for 1 spot is to do a monthly rental rather than per night to save money on accommodation For context: I've been to thailand recently. Stayed in Koh Yao Noi, Koh Lanta and those islands were very chill and laid back. Could ride a rented motorcycle anywhere, stayed in an apartment and it was really cozy.

Food is usually great, people very pleasant and open, as long as you stay away from the red-light areas, and social issues like the King. It also has a more relaxed attitude towards visa runs (although they've started tightening the screws), a nomad visa, etc. Malaysia is also a bit uptight regarding visa runs, and has this ESTA-like MDAC declaration, which you must file before coming to Malaysia (as opposed to a 2-year validity for ESTA).

You would be better off taking a tourist visa for 3 months and do border runs although many people on Facebook have shared that they are being denied entry as immigration in South-East Asia is cracking down on this. The Thai DTV asks for 500.000 baht on your bank account which is about $14,360 and the Thai Digital Nomad visa is the cheapest and easiest one to get at the moment. If you want to extend that visa, that amount still needs to be on your bank account which means that you can‚Äôt touch it or you need to add to it before extending. Nobody actually cares about how long you have been employed, they only look at remote working permission from your employer which needs to be stipulated in your work contract. Permanent residency is difficult to get outside of Europe. Excuse me if i am not aware of any other visas but from the ones in South-East Asia, this is what I know. The visa itself has a different price in every currency but it‚Äôs ¬£300 for the UK and also $300 for the US I believe but some have paid the equivalent of $400. It‚Äôs valid for 5 years and you can only stay 180 per year (6 months) before you need to leave and re-enter for another 180 days and you can continue doing this for 5 years.

1jj7xpc,"Hi. I've been living in Vietnam for almost a year, staying on successive 90-day visas. There doesn't seem to be a problem with doing it indefinitely. I'm considering a move to KL and am wondering if anyone has experience doing back-to-back 90-day stays there. A cursory search states that while it's technically not forbidden, *""immigration officers have the discretion to deny entry if they suspect abuse of the system"".* I'm retired so I don't fit for a DM or professional visa. I do not quite qualify for the MM2H visa, even by the 50+ yo standards, unfortunately. Plus, I'm not committed to staying there permanently... I'd just like to get a 1-year price on an apartment. On a previous stay in KL I did a weekend visa run , after having been there \~90 days, and it was not an issue on reentry. I got a fresh 90.

There are reasons for this (non-justifiable) that I think a lot others here have shared, but the bottom line is basically owners want to make things easy for them and agents don't really have any incentives to change that mindset. Despite being a Malaysian, I run the risk of getting discriminated as well. What I normally do is I try to lead with my best foot forward i.e being transparent about my pay and job. I also try to build that rapport with the agent, so they will be more confident in vouching for me. If it is not this unit, there will be others. If I'm not wrong, what typically happens is agent might not share your profile to owners who only prefers a certain race. However, its not the race that they are necessarily concerned with but rather certain aspects like can you afford to pay, will you pay on time, will you keep the house clean or will you be doing illegal activities. If you can convince the agent that you're good on this front, they might be willing to vouch for you. After all, the sooner they can close the listing, the faster they will get paid and can move on to the next. Another option, one that I have not tried is to reach out to folks from your country or in you case perhaps continent. They might be able to hook you up with their agent (who probably have much better experiences with Africans) or some might even be agents themselves. I'm sure you can find these communities on FB.

1j9nwgd,"Hi everyone, My husband and I are a gay couple in our 40s, both Chinese, and we‚Äôve been married for years back in the USA. We‚Äôre seriously considering moving to Kuala Lumpur for the long haul‚Äîthink settling down, buying property, and eventually retiring there. We‚Äôre also planning to bring our parents to live with us. Malaysia‚Äôs MM2H (Malaysia My Second Home) program looks appealing for this, and we‚Äôre ready to invest in a home in KL. Here‚Äôs our situation: * We‚Äôre both out to our families, and they‚Äôre fully supportive of our relationship. * We‚Äôre also looking to run an international trade business, so a strong English-speaking environment is a big plus for us. * We want a place where we can live comfortably as a gay couple, even if we‚Äôre not super loud about it‚Äîjust a peaceful, practical life. * We‚Äôve been comparing Kuala Lumpur with Bangkok, actually. Thailand is obviously more progressive‚Äîsame-sex marriage is legal, and it‚Äôs super gay-friendly. But the downside is that English isn‚Äôt as widely spoken there, which could be tricky for our business and day-to-day life. Malaysia, on the other hand, has a much stronger English-speaking culture, which we love, but we‚Äôre unsure about how welcoming it is for a gay couple long-term. We‚Äôre feeling pretty torn. KL ticks a lot of boxes for us‚Äîaffordable living, good infrastructure, English usage‚Äîbut we‚Äôre worried about how our relationship might be perceived or if it could cause issues down the line. We don‚Äôt need a rainbow-flag-waving scene; we‚Äôre just a regular couple in our 40s looking to settle down and grow old together. So, what do you think? Is KL a realistic option for us? Any expats, locals, or others with experience living there as part of the LGBTQ+ community who can weigh in? How‚Äôs life in KL for a gay couple who‚Äôs low-key but still wants to feel at home?

On the ground, I was pretty much forced to learn street malay if I wanted to get exactly what I need (unless you just intend to buy Western products from the mall, but then even Bangkok would fill the same need, I'd think). It's always hard to advice a fellow Americans to move here because I don't know how careful you wish to be and what sort of freedom you actually expect. It's possible to do drugs, be gay, be promiscuous and a lot of other stuffs that are formally legally forbidden, but you need to be smart and discrete about it. It will have to stay at home pretty much entirely. Would you be ready to lie that your husband is ""just a friend"", if asked, or have no affectionate contact in public (not even holding hands)? If yes, then nobody will specifically go after you. Plenty of men and women walk the street in pair, and nobody says anything (in KL itself you can even see locals who are clearly ""together"", but they still never show being a couple in any final way). Likely nothing would happen in the street, because people would assume you're tourists (you can expect a few gawkers, but no violence in busy urban areas), but your neighbors might be ""weirded out"" if you explicitly told them, unless they lived abroad. Some people on reddit will tell you it's ""**completely** fine"", but that's because that's the world they want to live in, not the world they actually live in. I prefer to give you the uglier, but probably closer to the truth, version. Why not come and visit and see if it's comfy first? If it's too oppressive, you'll know within a week I think.

In my last office, my boss was gay, we had a few openly LGBT staff as well, and even celebrated pride in the office, so you can dictate what kind of culture your business will have. Of course there are downsides to living in a Muslim majority country. Raids happen from time to time at gay bar/club/event, although only the Malaysian Muslims would get in trouble, but it's definitely not an inviting environment.

I dont know and I think there's no point to know the exact details of the jail term and fines, just know that it's not worth the risk. The only time where you want to probably risk it is if you've had a few drinks and the police is the one that initiates or hints that he can let you go for a price. Cause if you get caught for driving under the influence it's mandatory jail sentence now. The law was changed; a few years back you can get away with fines. The rate of bribe has gone to a few hundred RM to a few thousand now. They know that you'll pay otherwise you'll go to jail. If it's just getting caught for using the phone or running a red light I would just accept the summons and pay the fine. It could be a few hundred bucks which is relatively cheap compared to getting caught for trying to bribe a police officer.

lwqmyh0,"Let‚Äôs ask Chat GPT Malaysia has made significant progress over the years in terms of economic growth, infrastructure, and standard of living. However, it is still classified as a developing or upper-middle-income country by organizations like the World Bank. Several factors contribute to this classification: 1. Income Distribution and Inequality: While Malaysia has a relatively high GDP per capita, there is still significant income inequality. The income gap between urban and rural populations, as well as among different ethnic groups, poses challenges for the nation‚Äôs development status. 2. Economic Dependence on Natural Resources: Malaysia‚Äôs economy is heavily dependent on natural resources, such as palm oil, petroleum, and natural gas. This reliance can make the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices, potentially affecting long-term economic stability. 3. Innovation and High-Value Industries: Although Malaysia has a strong manufacturing sector, much of it focuses on assembly rather than high-value or high-tech innovation. Moving toward a knowledge-based economy with advanced technology sectors can be essential for achieving developed status. 4. Education Quality and Workforce Skills: The education system in Malaysia has improved, but there are gaps in quality and access, particularly in rural areas. For a country to be considered developed, a highly skilled and innovative workforce is often crucial. 5. Social and Institutional Reforms: Developed countries typically have strong institutions and governance structures. Malaysia still faces challenges related to corruption, regulatory efficiency, and policy transparency, which can hinder further progress toward a developed status. 6. Sustainability and Environmental Concerns: Developed nations increasingly focus on sustainable development. Malaysia has made strides, but it faces challenges balancing economic growth with environmental protection, such as deforestation, urban pollution, and biodiversity preservation. Achieving developed nation status often involves reforms that promote a more inclusive economy, diversification beyond resources, and enhancing innovation, sustainability, and governance.

1kxckua,"Hello everyone, I'm a 24-year-old guy from France, graduating this July with a degree in mechanical engineering. I've just landed a great job opportunity with a company based in Kuala Lumpur, right next to the Petronas Towers. I speak French, Spanish, and English fluently, have some basic Thai, and I'm currently learning Mandarin. I'll be moving to KL for a few years and had a few questions about life there. First, since my office is near the Petronas Towers, do you have any recommendations for nice condos nearby with a gym and a swimming pool? I'm looking for a place that's comfortable to live in, with a budget of around 2000‚Äì2500 MYR. Second, I‚Äôm curious about the dating scene in KL. What‚Äôs it like? Do people usually meet through apps or in person? Any tips or experiences‚Äîgood or bad, would be helpful. Lastly, what's the best way to meet locals, I am not the kind of person that only hang out with expats ? if you're based in KL and looking for someone to hang out with or do sports/activities, feel free to message me! I‚Äôll be arriving on September 1st, 2025. Thanks in advance!

For the first six months, the tax rate deducted from your salary is 30%. You can only get this back when filing your tax return, which, if you start in 2025, you might receive by April 2026. Transportation and quality of life ‚Äì Public transportation here is much better than in Metro Manila, so you won‚Äôt have trouble getting around. The cost of essential goods (food, toiletries, etc.) is 20%-30% cheaper when converted to pesos. For example, if a BigMac in the Philippines costs Php 250.00, it‚Äôs only about Php 200.00 here in KL when converted to Philippine Peso Cost of living ‚Äì It‚Äôs cheaper here compared to the Philippines. In the Philippines, you can rent a solo condo room (with shared areas for cooking, laundry, and dining) for about Php 12k - Php 15k, whereas in KL, you can get a similar setup for about Php 6.5k - Php 9k. Security and crime rate ‚Äì In Metro Manila, almost everything is a danger zone, except for places like BGC (sometimes). In KL, there are only a few areas that are considered dangerous. You also don‚Äôt have to be afraid to pull out your phone because snatchers and robbers are rare. Metro Manila has become so unsafe lately that it‚Äôs sometimes scary to go outside. Recreational activities ‚Äì KL has many green spaces for a capital city. There are plenty of public parks and open spaces to relax during weekends or when you‚Äôre bored at home. There are still many trees here, even though it‚Äôs considered a city. In Metro Manila, there‚Äôs hardly any open green space‚ÄîDiliman is the only one I can think of. Overall: The cost of living for a Filipino professional who isn‚Äôt extravagant or lavish is around Php 18,000 - Php 22,000 per month when converted to pesos.

Also people who have had real Wagyu will know that no sane people will go for the third bite because of how rich it is. It literally takes a toll on your body to consume it, that‚Äôs why places in Japan serve it in small portions with thin cut slices.

micdmz2,"Dirty carnivore here. I consume a lot of beef in my diet, say maybe 80% of the time. And with this I lost shit tons of weight... But anyways Wagyu = Japanese cow There's pure blood = 100% Japanese cow and there's crossbred wagyu ie. bred with other breeds like Holstein or Hartford etc Anywhere you go you can get both types of Wagyu In Japan, crossbred are labeled as F1 etc. Pure blood starts with an A In Australia if they don't specify the type (ie. Pure blood wagyu) then they're crossbred. There are world famous Australian farms that produces award winning pure bloods like Blackmore or Mayura.. major difference is that Australian regulation forces the farms to allow the cows to roam free vs kept locked in cages like in Japan.. therefore pureblood Australian cows do not grow as big as the Japanese ones lah (just like active vs sedentary folks) Same goes with American farms.. Different country uses different grading for their beef.. Japan uses F and A, Australia uses MB (wagyu are normally MB4 and above), America calls them choice, select, prime (prime is typically MB5 and above) and there is no designation beyond prime Grades are assigned after slaughter.. based on yield (size) and intermuscular fat (marbling).. Ribeye from a grass fed Limousine cow (like the ones in Malaysia) are small, maybe a couple of inches in diameter vs an A5 Ribeye, which can get as big as my face üòÖ Universally the MB grading can be applied to all beef.. Japan goes all the way up to MB12 (A5) Australian pureblood goes up to MB9+ American Prime goes up to MB5+ Types of cuts Chicken have dark and white meat.. when you go to KFC in the US for example, they'll ask if you want white or dark.. white = no moving muscles (ie. Breast), dark are moving muscles (ie. Wings, thighs, drumsticks) Scientifically white and dark meat should be cooked at different temperatures to pastureze and break down the connective tissue. But the differences between white and dark meat in chicken is minor When it comes to beef and lamb etc.. the differences are amplified. Instead of labelling them as white or dark meat, the difference muscles are split between steak cuts and roast/braised/bbq cuts Steak cuts are the muscles where you can cook hot and fast on a pan, grill, etc. Because cows are on all fours, these are the muscles along their spine (from front: chuck, ribeye, splits into striploin/NY strip and tenderloin/batang pinang). These are also called prime cuts There are secondary ""steak"" cuts like the rump or sirloin. Not as tender but you can cook them hot and fast. The roast/braised/bbq cuts required a long cook process at low heat (braised in oven, slow roast/bbq/smoke). Ribs, briskets, topsides..these are tough muscles even if they have beautiful marbling.. Americans like their steaks nice and thick.. thick steaks or big roast/bbq.. different parts of Americas favors different cuts.. Texas briskets, Florida Tri Tips, Brasil/Argentina Picanha.. Japanese/Koreans tend to slice them thin (even tough cuts like kalbi, tongue, karubi etc when cut thin then doesn't feel tough) Some people prefer thick steaks with a bit of a bite, some prefer lean, some prefer fatty, some prefers tender.. And just like anything else, the price of the cuts are based on market forces: supply and demand.. famous cuts like ribeye, NY, tenderloin, porterhouse, Tomahawk are well recognized cuts, most restaurants sell them, demand high, price are high lah BBQ cuts like ribs, briskets a lot more technical to cook.. higher cost to cook even though cheaper to buy raw, but restaurants charge a lot of money.. so price 2x5 like steak cuts in restaurants And then there are underrated cuts like Petite Tender, Flat Iron, Memphis, Picanha etc which are wayyyyy cheaper compared to it's Prime cuts equivalent Typical markups for steaks/BBQ in Malaysia is 600% and hugher.. but if you buy them in bulk direct from supplier (like me) then they are wayyy cheaper.. keep in mind that grocery stores already mark up the raw beef they sell there by approx 100% so you can save a lot of money by buying bulk, as long as you meet their MOQ üòÖ",positive,negative,0.5361,positive,0.9987

n2b9tap,"Factual comments: 1. Prior to 2022, it would have been impossible to create this chart using [traditional DOSM population data.]( Because DOSM data is in 5y age groups (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, etc), and the oldest group is 85+; no visibility on Centenarians. 2. After the implementation of automatic voter registration, *every single citizen* who is still alive appears in SPR data. This enables us to get amazing insight into our population! 3. At the time of GE-15 in 2022, there were 25,445 living Centenarians in Malaysia. The only previous announcement I can find is from 2015, when Menteri KDN (Zahid at the time) announced that there were [43,599 aged 100+ still alive.]( If true, this is a HUGE drop over just 8 years. I'm guessing the pandemic had something to do with that. The chart above contains a detail that I find absolutely insane: * More men than women from ages 18 to 46 * More women than men from ages 47 to 99 * More men aged 100+ I have a few (speculative) theories for why this pattern emerges: 1. For the younger age groups, I'm guessing it's the effect of marriage between foreigners and locals, after which the foreigner gets citizenship. Since our foreign resident population is predominantly male, it makes sense that we see more men in the working age range. 2. At higher ages, the 'women live longer' effect becomes clear. This is a well-established finding globally for a number of reasons: Men have more dangerous lifestyles (both work and non-work related), men smoke more, drink more, are more obese, and so on. However, while the general conclusion that 'women live longer' is well-known, I was surprised that the stats are so solid - not a single age from 47 onwards has more living men than women! 3. We know there was hanky panky with our voter roll in the past (almost certainly not anymore), with giving of easy citizenship to foreigners. These foreigners would have mostly been male and young. However, the pattern I cannot explain is why the 'women live longer' trend reverses after age 100!",positive,positive,0.6983,positive,0.999

Assuming if a female is widowed at age 40+ back 50 years ago, the female would have 'lost' 15+ years worth of income that the husband may otherwise have been earning. Since there are more female from age 47-99, we can assume there are more widows than widower withount accounting for situations of multiple wives, and with the assumption that males tend to hold more dangerous work, it is a very likely that there are more widows than widower. \- As a continuation of the above points, some family may allocate a higher inheritence to their sons over their daughters due to family tradition, religious tradition and what not.

1ilfd5x,"Mods are seeing a noticeable increase in users using ChatGPT and similar tools not only to create posts but also to post *entire* responses in comments, disguised as genuine personal advice. The sub is one of the biggest on Reddit and as a community it's so important - particularly for a topic like travel which is rooted in authentic human experiences - that all responses come in the form of genuine opinions and guidance. There's absolutely no point in us all being on here otherwise. Mods have tools to identify these sort of posts, but it's worth reiterating moving into 2025 and with increased AI available in our day-to-day lives that any usage of this sort to make your posts or comments will result in an instant ban. The rules are stated very clearly in the sidebar and are not new. None of us joined this community to read regurgitated information from a machine learning model like ChatGPT. AI tools can have their place for travellers sometimes, but outside of the occasional spellcheck or minor translation it should never be the main foundational element for any of your posts on this sub. We want responses to be *your* opinions and knowledge. If you're asking a question, we want it to be in *your* voice. If you suspect any usage we haven't spotted, report it - we are a group of volunteers on a huge sub and things often slip through the net.

1lw10po,"Hey guys, Looking for a bit of advice and any experience from travellers who have been in a similar scenario. I flew from Manchester to Austin 9 days ago with British Airways. I currently live in Austin and was back in Manchester for a wedding. When I arrived at Austin airport my baggage wasn‚Äôt there - no problem, the BA assistant asked me to fill out a form with a pen and paper and she informed me that the luggage would be sent out the next day. I did offer to come back to the airport to collect but they said they‚Äôd handle it. The following day I had a missed call from a random number whilst I was working. I immediately called back and the call went straight to voicemail. I then received a text saying they have attempted to deliver my luggage unsuccessfully. This was a third party company called ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my suitcase‚Äù - ironically named considering that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve wanted to know for the last week! After numerous back and forth with BA and this mysterious company who are pretty much uncontactable, BA informed me that WMS had left a note on my file saying that I answered the phone call on the day of delivery and ‚Äútold them to f*** off‚Äù - something I would never say to anyone unnecessarily, but even more so if they are the bridge between me and my belongings. I asked for proof of this phone call to which BA couldn‚Äôt give me, but concluded that when I wrote down my number at Austin airport the assistant who helped me must have added my number into the system incorrectly - however I have since realised that this can‚Äôt be true because WMS did try to call me when they were delivering the bag. I believe this is probably some sort of tactic for the delivery driver to not have to wait around for too long and return those item back to WMS‚Äô warehouse or return the suitcase back to the airport for BA to deal with. For the past week I‚Äôve been trying to find my luggage - and eventually spoke to someone at BA a few days ago who said that my suitcase was at the warehouse with their third party courier (WMS) and they will inform them to return it to the airport. This morning I spoke with BA who confirmed my baggage was at the airport. I left work, spent $25 to head from Downtown Austin to the airport at around 12:30 and spent the next 3 hours at the airport trying to find my luggage. Every staff member at BA I spoke to brought up the fact that there was a note on my file saying I had been rude to the delivery driver (genuinely driving me insane because it didn‚Äôt happen!!!) and none of them could locate my bag. They then decided they would pay me out for my lost belongings - and handed me a post it note to write down my name, number, and the value of the items inside the suitcase. I left the airport and booked a taxi - no longer than 5 minutes later the woman I had last spoke to rang me and said she had found the suitcase! I went back to the desk and was really really grateful that this lady had gone out of her way to find it. She said the suitcase had been left in a closet in the BA office at the airport as they didn‚Äôt really know what to do with it considering the note they had received from the delivery driver was that the person they had tried to contact (me) had told them not only to ‚Äúf*** off‚Äù - but also ‚Äúnot to ring this number again‚Äù. (Genuinely laughable that any person rotating 2 pairs of underpants until they have their suitcase back would say this) I returned to work and then about an hour ago got back to my apartment to finally unpack, to discover that 50% of the items in my suitcase are missing. Someone has been through it and picked out the more expensive items. I treat myself to nice clothes when I can afford to - they‚Äôve taken shirts, t shirts, trainers, shorts, trousers, a bottle of aftershave I hadn‚Äôt even opened yet. I have just rang the lady at BA who rang me when she found my suitcase - and she said this has never happened before and she will ‚Äúinvestigate further‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything she can do. Am I just in a scenario of their word against mine? I don‚Äôt want to be a Karen but the fact that someone has gone through my luggage is really not sitting right with me. Is this a police matter? I can prove that I purchased most of the items that are missing but some of which were gifted to me. The delivery company seem very sketchy, and I already know they lied about what I said to them on the phone - I 100% never spoke to anyone at that company. The lady at BA said where the bag was left would have been secure and there is CCTV that she is going to look through, she admitted the only time the bag was not under surveillance was when the delivery driver was in possession of it. Any thoughts/advice on next steps moving forward would be greatly appreciated - or even hearing from someone that has been in a similar situation and managed to get some sort of resolve. (Sorry for the Ted talk - I do feel much better for venting, thanks!)",positive,positive,0.7512,positive,0.9998

Never been to Scotland nor Northern Ireland, which is why: I'd welcome any suggestions of where to go, maybe including some ""culture spots"" (Castles? or Distilleries?) or whatever you think if worthwhile visiting.

You need to check whether the huts are open in the time you want to travel and some of them you have to prebook at least 6 months in advance. That said, you don't have to hike the whole thing at once. You could base yourself either in Chamonix or in Courmayeur and do day hikes from there. You could hike half of the TMB that way, for example. Given those two choices, I would recommend Courmayeur. In those towns, no hut prebooking is necessary, one can just stay in the hotels and take public busses to the hiking starting points. You could also stay 3 days in Courmayeur and 3 days in Chamonix. The Interlaken area in Switzerland (Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald etc) is one of the most beautiful places I have seen nature wise. I am also an avid hiker and would recommend either Switzerland or the Mont Blanc area. The most amazing hike I have ever done was the Laugavegur hike in Iceland, but it has a very narrow window when you can do it. Not spring / autumn but only summer I believe, too dangerous otherwise.

One unique thing I remember about Melbourne's nightlife were the semi-hidden lane bars. I'm sure these days the info is all over social media, but back when I visited in the pre-smartphone days, you kinda had to discover them via word of mouth.

I am still scatter brained but I do feel more grounded and more like myself. I knew I wanted to try a part of the Camino and also surf in San Sebasti√°n so for me it was an opportunity to do both. My gf was gone for 10 days so most likely I would sit on couch at home and rot away on my phone. Maybe I would go out to meet friends 1-2x or play padel etc but still. It would just be the same old routines and I feel I needed a change. I did get lonely the first 3 days. Esp at dinner. I did solo dinner every single damn day. No take away. Just fucking sitting there in silence and getting weird looks from the restaurant staff people dining etc. I tried not be on my phone but people watch instead and again be alone with my thoughts. I met 2-3 people which I spent a decent amount of time with on the trial. A couple which I hiked with for a few hours. I met a bus driver, we exchanged numbers, and we got coffee and he showed me around Bilbao for a few hours. We both spoke Romanian so it was a connection point for us. I also met a French guy and hiked with him for an hour or so and grabbed lunch with him. So I wasn‚Äôt completely alone. I tried to talk to restaurant staff, hotel staff, whoever I could and learn from them. I had some great conversations. I felt lonely a lot esp in the first few days. But then the anxiety went away. I was considering leaving early at one point but I‚Äôm so happy I stuck it out. I wasn‚Äôt planning on losing weight. I didn‚Äôt mean to make it a workout etc. it was just fucking hot and I overpacked and I didn‚Äôt sleep well so I would wake up late and hike 12-8pm hottest part of the day. The majority of 8 hours I would have either dripping sweat or at least be somewhat sweaty so I lost a lot of weight like that. My appetite wasn‚Äôt as big as I thought it would be mostly due to heat.

1lvekna,"Every time I want to go somewhere, it's like an endless test. Tons of paperwork, insane visa fees, long waiting times, and zero guarantee I'll even get approved. I love my country, but carrying a weak passport is just‚Ä¶ not it. It gets worse because I'm a freelancer. No long-term labor contract = extra suspicious. So I have to dig up contracts from my clients, I work with fintech companies in the US like Hood, SoFi, WTF, etc. I have to screenshot the signed contracts with their names on it, get these companies to verify my identity, show bank statements matching the payments, highlight every detail so the embassy doesn't think I'm faking it? And sometimes if I'm traveling with my partner or anyone else in my family or my friends? More paperwork: photos together, proof of relationship, all that. And more savings. Because apparently if you don't have $10k+ sitting around, they won't believe you're coming back home. Meanwhile, after all that work and money spent, there's still a chance they'll just say no. No refund. Just a rejection stamp. I know why it's like this, there are so many people from poorer countries like mine who overstay or try to live illegally in richer countries. It happens all the time, so we get blacklisted. But it's depressing when you realize there's basically zero hope that your passport ranking will ever improve.

Dubrovnik (1 night) - I know it's supposed to be very touristy and pretty expensive, so I just want to go for 1 night to get a taste of it 5. Mostar (2 nights) 6. Sarajevo (5 nights) Let me know if you have any advice! The things I'm worried about are: 1. Am I doing too much? On previous solo trips I stayed in each place a bit longer, but I feel like a lot of the destinations here are pretty small.

There are some great nearby beaches and you can get a roundtrip taxi boat to nearby islands for 10-20 Euros. For a beautiful lesser-known beach, check out Mlini beach. Also worth catching a boat tour to explore the caves and nearby islands. I did a 6-hour boat tour that was well worth the money. Dubrovnik was great. I spent three nights there and found more to do there than Split and Hvar. Expensive and touristy but plenty to do. Great nearby beaches and plenty of great restaurants & bars.

n2cs3iy,"Hi! American living in the UK here. I would like to emphasize how hostile to walking cities are in the US. Walking in most of these cities just isn't feasible for doing more than essentially the high street. What I mean by that is that in places like Nashville and Austin you physically cannot get from some points to another without a car as you'd be walking along major highways which is illegal. Additionally these cities are spread out, let's say you're staying in Colorado Springs downtown area, it will take about 2hrs to get to the Red Rock Canyon entrance walking, and the walk isn't through picturesque scenes it's grueling suburbia at best. Public transit is irregular, unreliable, and has large gaps in availability. They also don't have regular stops in the same way as the UK, you could still be looking at a 30-1hr long walk as your closest bus stop. So you'll be relying on Ubers a lot to get to and from places. The issue with that, if you're looking to hike in nearby national parks/forests is that you run the risk of getting stranded as the drive out may not be worth the time for the drivers to come pick you up. Vegas, Savannah, and New Orleans are the only cities I would find doable without a car, and in these places you'll not be in the outdoors like national parks, they also have heavy party/drinking cultures.

But with a disability, you can forget about all the lines, having to make reservations at most attractions, and even paying! I wrote a whole trip report about this on Tripadvisor. The one caveat is that you have to have ""proof"" of your disability, such a disability card, or a medical letter. We don't have that in the US, but a car handicapped placard worked. But only once or twice did they even ask. When they saw my partner's gait, they usually immediately ushered both of us to the front and right through the door no questions asked. Oh yes, and one other person with the disabled traveler gets to go along for the ride -free entry and skip all lines. I know this is a solo travel sub, but if you can coral a companion, it's an excellent chance for them to experience Paris without the usual annoyances of the hideous lines. Public transit and healthcare are excellent. The only thing is that there are few elevators to the Metro. However, buses are frequent and reliable, and the Bonjour RATP app tells you exactly how to get from any point to any other point -much better than google. \*The only caveat... not sure if a temporary disability counts. But if you have a doctor's letter, you should be good. \*Second small caveat... they won't let you go to the very top level of the Eiffel Tower. We finagled it anyway, but it was technically not allowed. Otherwise, they'll bend over backwards to accommodate you.

I think you could consider smaller-sized cities as I find capitals or big cities tend to be quite busy and require a lot of walking. Bilbao meets all your criteria for example, you could visit Santander too. Majorca is nice, though you'd rely more on taxis and some parts are hilly (same with Tenerife, or Corfu). I really struggled with confidence and anxiety, so make sure you choose somewhere there is less of a language barrier and where they have a lot of tourists - and adapt your expectations. It's worth telling your accomodation you're on crutches so they don't put you on the fourth floor or something. For the airport, I recommend going to the assistance part, they'll give a sunflower lanyard which means you can go in the assistance lane through security which is much quicker and generally the staff will give you a bit more time. You put your crutches through the scanner, they give you a stick to walk through if you need. In the airplane you'll put them in the overhead luggage compartment.

I haven‚Äôt booked a hotel yet, and I‚Äôm still figuring out my itinerary. Right now, I‚Äôm considering 2 options. I might spend two days in Milan, then two days in a nearby area like Lake Como, and return to Milan the night before my departure. Or I might stay in Milan for the entire four days and do day trips during the last two. fyi, I visited Rome and Florence earlier this year, so I‚Äôm not new to Italy. I‚Äôm not really into nightlife or clubbing, but I enjoy good food, visiting museums, and sightseeing. I‚Äôm not looking to do nature trails or long hikes, though I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing beautiful or relaxing places nearby. I follow a mediterranean diet, so I‚Äôm already familiar with the local food, and I‚Äôd love to try some great regional dishes. Overall, I‚Äôm just looking for a chill and enjoyable trip that feels right for a 24yo solo traveler. so which itinerary would you recommend given my interests and the fact that I‚Äôm arriving and departing from MXP? Second, where should I stay in terms of location and specific hotels, if possible? I‚Äôm looking for something around 150 euros/night Also, I‚Äôd really appreciate recommendations for restaurants, museums, and places worth visiting.

n2605qj,"I recently did Sabah, landing in Tawau for Semporna, then flew to Sandakan to do the Kinabatangan river safari and finally flew to KK. * Semporna - unless you're seeing the islands/ diving, it is extremely polluted in the town and there are no nice beaches on mainland in the area. So if you're going, at least have some day trips planned if you're not staying on one of the surrounding islands. I was lucky enough to be hanging with some locals at the time, so I ate REALLY well. :D * Sandakan, don't spend too much time in the town itself, the Orangutan and Sunbear sanctuaries close by are worth it but you don't need more than half a day to do them both. Double check the feeding times for the Orangutans as you'll plan your day by that. The pick up to the Kinabatangan river safari was from here. I recommend doing 2 nights as you have more chance to see the animals, the 1 night feels very rushed. *Kota Kinabalu - it's a small city, so lots of malls etc. Many many food options. The tours to the islands didn't get good reviews because I think they are just very busy. I did a sunset tour around the mangroves to see the fireflies, which I personally really enjoyed. The sunset beach was very busy, again, so I didn't get many good pics. I really wish I had the budget and time to climb Mount Kinabalu, so might have to go back one day. What surprised me about Sabah in general was how busy it is. All the cities and towns were also incredibly polluted, with Semporna being the worst I've ever seen.

Edit: Not to be a dick, and I hope you enjoyed your time here, and as a responsible visitor. Norway has, like a lot of countries, had an influx of tourisme, both local and foreign. Especially the nature in north is sought after. The thing is, the infrastructure is not set up for this, and it has been cracking for a while now, trying to accommodate more visitors as that brings in revenue, but being poorly underfunded from the state for that. New regulations are coming. We also have this ""right to roam"" that secures access to nature for all, but it does have regulations, and please follow those. Its on how far away from a building you can stay, on what kind of land you can stay, and for how long. This is really getting abused and not followed, and if it continues we could lose this right in certain areas. Like everywhere else, act as if you are visiting, be respectful of the laws and regulations, carry out your rubbish and shit, and do leave some money behind locally. Small places have small budgets, but has to try to have service and infrastructure to a whole hoard of visitors not paying tax to that purpose. Dont feed the huge chains like supermarkets and Airbnb, but think small and local. Airbnb is here like everywhere helping to drive out locals. Other than that, please come! I recommend going in shoulder seasons, if thinking up north or the west coast. Cheaper and way way less busy. Lofoten started to fill up 15 years ago, now its madness.

1lvm3dn,"I‚Äôve been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina and rolled into Villa O‚ÄôHiggins with no time to spare. This was the end of the Carretera Austral, a small, sobering harbor at the bottom of a grueling 800-mile marathon down the Chilean side of Patagonia. The only way south from there was bookending two ferry connections with the most remote hike-a-bike border crossing of my entire life, a section I‚Äôd dreamt of since setting out from the Arctic Ocean. Traversing Lago Desierto is a very specific badge of bikepacking honor. Like many modernizing nations, Argentina‚Äôs immigrations system has gone entirely digital [to the dismay of colorful passport stamp chasers]. But in the glacial wilderness surrounding Mount Fitz Roy lies a tiny customs shack so isolated that they still use the faded old stamps and crumpled ledgers we‚Äôve come to love. It‚Äôs a special kind of prize that I‚Äôd long looked forward to. More than a keepsake. A ceremony. Approaching the Antarctic Islands and Tierra del Fuego meant that weather here was torrential at best, severely unpredictable. Sailors refer to these latitudes as the ‚ÄúRoaring Forties‚Äù and ‚ÄúFurious Fifties.‚Äù Centuries of hardy fear have instilled the old mariner‚Äôs proverb: ‚ÄúBelow 40 degrees there is no law, and below 50 degrees there is no God.‚Äù Boat services across Lago O‚ÄôHiggins vary by the wind and can be delayed by up to a week at a time. I lucked out with a ticket first, then again with a nearby bike mechanic who lent a few more spokes to spare. Everything was broken. Rain gear, no longer waterproof. My bike had grown resistant to the finish line, it seemed. And in some ways I had as well. A ragged band of cyclists and backpackers stumbled aboard, all having started from various points in different countries, but all en route to El Chalt√©n. We piled everyone‚Äôs gear inside a cramped passenger ferry and lashed our bikes to a railing above its helm, chopping across the first lake at breakneck speed towards a lonesome dock named Candelario Mancilla and the Fitz Roy backcountry beyond.",negative,positive,0.9397,negative,0.8579

1lvrf8v,"Hey guys! I just went on an awesome backpacking trip over the 4th of July weekend and wanted to share. I spent 3 days in the Jennie Lakes Wilderness and had perfect conditions. Bluebird skies, 60-degree temps, alpine lake swims, and zero stress. I recently co-created an outdoor app called Fethr which I used to plan my trip and I wanted to share that experience. Maybe it can help you on your future trips! I used Fethr‚Äôs route creation feature and trail map to help me decide where I wanted to go. I settled on a scenic loop through Jennie Lakes, camping at a different lake each night. I ended up with an itinerary of 6.6 miles the first day from Big Meadows Trailhead to Jennie Lake, 8.7 miles from Jennie Lake through JO Pass to Weaver Lake on the second day, and wrapped up the trip with 3.4 miles back to the trailhead on the last day. The route creation allowed me to use custom waypoints showing my camping spots and parking on the map, while also showing each day‚Äôs mileage and elevation summary. Once I had my route dialed in, I created a trip report in Fethr to organize all the key details: trailhead info, daily itinerary, camp spots, and notes. Knowing I‚Äôd be off-grid, I also downloaded the offline map of the area, which ended up working great because I lost signal as soon as I passed through the entrance of Sequoia National Park on my way to the trailhead. Using the offline maps, custom routes and tracking, I could follow along with my route without getting lost. Which was a blessing in disguise, because I noticed that JO Pass seems to be a lot less traveled than the trail to both Jennie and Weaver Lakes. There were a few times where I didn‚Äôt notice a turn and started hiking off trail, but was able to quickly get back on track by looking at my route. I also created a dedicated pack with gear pulled straight from my Gear List. Since this was a holiday weekend and not too many miles each day, I decided to bring a few ‚Äúluxury‚Äù items with me, including fishing gear and a floatie for the lake. I wanted to try my hand at fishing and although I was able to successfully cast, I couldn‚Äôt find any interested fish. I did look around for some trout while on the floatie, but it seems the fish may be sparse. The views in the Sierras never disappoint, and this trip was no exception. If you are able to, I definitely recommend taking the longer loop from Jennie Lake through the JO Pass and over to Weaver Lake. There are some steep inclines, but the creek crossings and mountain views make it all worth it. I uploaded my favorite photos into that same trip report I mentioned earlier, so it‚Äôs all there to revisit whenever I want to look back on this trip. I also shared the trip on my Fethr profile, so others in the community can check it out and maybe even use it as a jumping-off point for their own adventure. This trip reminded me why I love backpacking, but it also showed me how much smoother it can be when the logistics are handled. Fethr kept me organized, safe, and in the moment. It was just me, the forest, and the freedom to enjoy it all. **TL;DR:** Jennie Lakes Wilderness is absolutely beautiful and I used Fethr to help me plan smarter, hike safer, and enjoy every moment without getting bogged down by logistics. If you haven‚Äôt used the app for a full trip yet, do it. This one felt effortless, and I‚Äôm already dreaming up the next one.

n2brp28,"**1.) Travel Insurance:** Personally I never bother with this. I don't really care about late/cancelled flights, lost luggage, accommodation screw-ups, etc. And if that stuff does happen my credit card has lots of coverage to take care of those normal travel hassles. **2.) Emergency Medical Insurance:** That's another issue entirely. I travel to a lot of developing countries and sometimes I'm doing stuff (like motorcycling, etc.) that increases risk. If a medical emergency happens then I instantly want the best care possible, including emergency medivac (which is insanely expensive) to a centre with real medical facilities. I also want repatriation insurance to get me home. This is especially important at a destination with little or no medical infrastructure, or a country like the US where medical care is insanely expensive. (One example, in Mongolia one of my film crew suffered an accident and the emergency medivac to Bangkok cost over $70K USD, completely paid for by my insurance. It saved her leg though, and maybe even her life.) **Bottom line:** Insurance is the most useless waste of money you can spend on your trip, *until an emergency happens,* then of course it's the best investment you ever made.

I travel with carry-on only so lost/damaged luggage is never a factor. 3.) If accommodation screws up I just go to an alternative down the street or whatever. Again, I just go with the flow.

I did the Chinese Transit Without Visa program where I entered from Hong Kong and exited through Korea and was allowed 10 days. I‚Äôm not sure your nationality but on the other hand I can show up to Japan for 90 days visa free no problem, so that aspect is also easier. If you‚Äôre into more intrepid experiences and want to visit a place not all your friends are visiting, pick China. This is also anecdotal experience. I did not do any sort of tour in either of them and just find my own way, so other people maybe had great experiences while being a part of tours. Navigating Japan is so easy as they increased the English signage in Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics and Google/Apple maps work well. It‚Äôs just a low-stress destination imo. I would personally just pick the one you feel more excited about a visit the other another time.",positive,positive,0.9825,positive,0.9993
n28dfik,"Love traveling to both so much but personally would pick China over Japan. I am of Chinese background with knowledge of the language though, so the cultural differences are not as big of an issue for me, and I am a lot more comfortable there than in Japan. China is more difficult for most travelers as it requires a whole other set of apps and payment systems and in general there are not very many foreign tourists so most things are geared for domestic tourists. It‚Äôs louder, generally more crowded due to higher population, more in your face, and I think it‚Äôs one of the places you can go that can feel totally like you‚Äôre in another world. However it is one of the most geographically diverse and beautiful countries on the planet with such a long rich history and variety of cuisines and cultures to taste and learn about. Getting around by bullet train is also pretty easy and the public transit is amazing. If someone is up for a bit of a challenge and is interested in that sort of totally fish out of water, get really stuck into a different world experience, I think China is a great destination.

In my experience nature centric trips unfortunately kind of revolve around getting into a car, unless you‚Äôre staying in a more tropical place, but then it‚Äôs hot lol. Ok, so since you said it doesn‚Äôt have to be all the above, these are my main thoughts: Costa Rica: Hear me out. I‚Äôm also from the NE/US and since you say you don‚Äôt drive I‚Äôm going to take the risk and assume that like me, you have mostly grown up/lived in NE cities. The oppressive city heat we feel in summer here is not the same as the low 80s winter heat with a sea breeze there. Especially surrounded by nature and not concrete. I would suggest booking a dead winter, early December or February (i.e., when the kids are not on winter break) trip, when the weather is in the low 80s, right by Manuel Antonio, or the Cloud Forest, or one of the many awesome nature filled/surrounded towns many people here or the internet can recommend and get your nature fantasy on. Here‚Äôs why I think CR specifically despite the fact it‚Äôs tropical: 1. It‚Äôs super safe and you‚Äôll feel totally at ease as a female solo traveler. 2. You can travel at all different budgets. It‚Äôs not crazy cheap, but you can easily find a beautiful, but simple room, surrounded by nature at like $80 a night. Plus flights are cheap outside of holidays/winter break. 3. You can usually walk around the towns and people are really friendly, there‚Äôs usually a very relaxed vibe in most spots. Like you can walk to a really tasty/cozy breakfast spot, take a cab or bus to the beach, have an awesome lunch of a grilled tuna burger, cab or take a long walk back to your room, and then have 5 or 10 options of restaurants that are a 5 minute walk or a short cab ride away. More if you‚Äôre willing to adventure further. 4. It‚Äôs crazy relaxing while also being one of the most nature oriented places I‚Äôve been. Like you can‚Äôt leave your bathing suit to dry outside because the monkeys will steal it, but you can also sit on your terrace and watch them play in the trees in the evening while having a glass of wine. I also loved finding this little hiking trail to a little beach that we would hang out at all day, then explore around the rocks of the bay, or swim, or read. 5 bucks got you your chair and umbrella for the day. Another 10 was a drink and your burger. I think the country has found a good balance of not overdeveloping tourism wise (at least from what I saw). That‚Äôs what I think of when I want to decompress.

It actually snows and gets fairly cold in the winter, so a late summer/fall trip could be perfect for you. - Don‚Äôt drive: if you stay in a central part of Santa Fe, this shouldn‚Äôt be a huge problem.

After that, Santa Fe checks ALL your boxes. Outstanding food, very very quirky and interesting people, extremely friendly, slow pace, incredible art and museums, lots of live music, beautiful Southwestern architecture.

Great cafe up on Museum Hill too. - Meow Wolf - Galleries on Canyon Road - 10,000 Waves Spa - The Plaza and the Railyard of course, lots of shops, restaurants, music, bars, people, etc. - Take a ride on the Sky Railway with a history, stargazing, or scenery-focused tour - Valentina‚Äôs restaurant for a casual New Mexican meal, Time Travelers Gastropub for British pub food and interesting people.

Bear in mind there can be a lot of noise (open-air nightclubs until 5am, late-night bars, etc.). High-end options are Hotel Humano in La Punta and Casa Joseph in Zicatela. A good mid-range option is Hotel Raiz, in Brisas de Zicatela. 2. Food is similarly wide-ranging, beachside I would recommend La Olita in La Punta, and an amazing gem is Fish Shack, in a small alley also in La Punta. Bear in mind the sea can be very rough (red flag every day, but that didn't prevent people from swimming). 3. Be very careful of pack dogs. People are bitten very often (last Saturday it happened to my girlfriend). Go to Dr Diego or Dr Karla in Brisas, next to Pharma Puento, should it happen. Open on Sundays as well. 4.

1lttned,"Hi everyone, my partner and I are planning a 3-week camping trip this September with our tent. We‚Äôll be driving from the Netherlands and want to roadtrip through a country, mainly focused on nature and hiking. We're currently debating between Slovenia and Slovakia. To give you an idea of our travel style: we love doing 3-6 hour hikes in the mountains most days, and after we just chill at our tent (board games, reading, drink some local wine/beer, cooking our own meals on a shitty camping stove). We change campings every 3-5 days. On rainy days, we don‚Äôt mind visiting a museum, church, or caf√© but you'll mostly find us in nature. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs important to us: * **Beautiful nature hikes**. We prefer trails that aren‚Äôt overly artificial or paved. Mountains, creeks, waterfalls, and dazzling views make us very happy. The hikes dont need to be hardcore, just pretty. üòä * **Safety.** It must be 100% safe. From what I‚Äôve read, both countries seem fine in that regard. * **Peaceful green campsites**. We love quiet, nature-based campsites. We don‚Äôt mind basic facilities and older bathrooms. * **Less touristy**. I know touristic places are popular for a reason, but we‚Äôd rather avoid long lines, which is also why we are going in September. Some tourism is fine if can beat the crowds by going early. * **Basic English (or Dutch or French).** We don‚Äôt need fluency, but we prefer when people understand a few basic English words so we can order bread and such. * **Friendly people**. Not the most important point since we‚Äôll mostly be in nature, but it is highly appreciated. I heard some mixed messages about Slovakians being rude to tourists? We may spend one day in Bratislava or Ljubljana but city life or good food is not very important to us. Both countries are well within our budget. Both Slovenia and Slovakia seem to tick most of our boxes. The Julian Alps and the Tatra mountains both look stunning and neither seem very touristic. We are having a hard time choosing! What would you recommend?",positive,positive,0.9991,positive,0.9992

You can drive endlessly and encounter gorgeous scenery, lovely mountains, rivers. Bohinj had the vibe you are explaining for sure. There were a lot of sporty adventuring people biking, hiking, swimming, paddle boarding, camping. We stayed at a cute and rustic cabin right near the lake and swam every day on the lake in the mountains. There are also many gorge and waterfall hikes that we really enjoyed. You mentioned rain days, and one thing that I noticed was that in Slovenia we had many rain days, however it didn't seem to really hold people back at all. They'd be all geared up with rain gear and biking and hiking away. We actually did a hike in the full on rain, at Slap Savica to a beautiful waterfall. We also hiked Mostnica Gorge in the rain.

We split Lake Bled between 1 day for the Lake and 1 day for the Julian Alps circle. Upon leaving we stopped at the caves and then got to Rovinj in the afternoon for a walk around town. Next 2 days were for exploring Istria and the wonderful towns & food. I thought this was the perfect amount of time in each area. If it's your first time in Venice, 2 full days is no problem. If you feel it's too crowded, get out to some of the other islands like Murano.",positive,positive,0.9897,positive,0.9986

Bled/Ljubljana is a very pretty area, if you want adventure look into Soca valley for things like rafting. As a base for Slovenia would recommend looking into ""tourist farms"" if you're into that sort of thing, I've always had good experiences there. I like Skofja Loka as a potential base, very pretty town. Bled is cute but so is Bohinj, Ljubljana is a great chill city, no ""must-sees"" but a nice vibe. For Istria yeah, Rovinj is perfect as a base. Pula/Porec are nice enough towns with 1 major attraction each (the basilica and the amphitheater respectively). For beaches, just south of Rovinj there is the Zlatni rt which is lovely. Of the inland towns, I like Motovun and Vodnjan for a quick stop. If you eat meat, look into restaurants inland that serve lamb and/or homemade pasta - the town of Brtonigla in the very north of Istria is a bit of a hotspot for good food, for example.",positive,positive,0.9933,positive,0.9984
n1ckxjd,"Wow, embarrassing to admit you needed chatgpt to put that together. Is this doable on this budget? Yes, depending on what you're expecting out of it. We (2 adults) did manage approx 200 euro per day simply for food & room (with some leeway, Venice is expensive), but do keep in mind the additional transport costs and the expensive museums and such in Venice, plus tourist taxes and so on (also car hire with the deposit). Personally I would wait to rent a car until you get to Slovenia since it's a lot cheaper compared to Italy, so the rest of your budget will no longer simply be car costs. Going from Venice to Ljubljana is pretty easy, I did it by train in a couple of hours not that long ago. Lake Bled is beautiful and I highly recommend it (also less hot than Ljubljana). Tons of easy day hikes and interesting spots in the area. Slovenia is tiny and generally not really touristy in that way beyond the center of Ljubljana, so if you have a car you can see a lot of it if you pick a good place to base out of. Places like the Vitngar gorge (near Bled) or Predjama castle & the caves are great. Also, do you need to go back to Venice to fly out? There are tons of airports all over the place, some are really really cheap if you need to go to a more central hub to get home.",positive,positive,0.998,positive,0.9991

n1iby35,"Looks like a well-paced itinerary, and you‚Äôre already ahead of the curve by building in time to wander and not overpack the days. After helping thousands plan their Europe trips through Guide to Europe, I‚Äôve seen the same pattern again and again: the itineraries with a little breathing room tend to be the ones people remember most. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd think about your stops: **Vienna:** This city really shines when you slow down. One museum or palace, followed by a caf√© and a long walk, is more than enough for a full day. Sperl and Vollpension are both great for something classic but low-key, and the 7th district is worth a wander if you‚Äôre after a quieter local feel. **Budapest:** The baths and ruin bars are fun, but what tends to stick, for me and for a lot of travelers I‚Äôve talked to, is the slower side. Riding Tram 2 by the river at golden hour, grabbing dinner on the Buda side where it‚Äôs calmer. Pozsonyi Kisvend√©gl≈ë is one I always recommend. Simple, local, and never too crowded. **Paris:** It‚Äôs clich√© for a reason. The planned stops always deliver, but what stays with you tends to be the detours: a canal-side bakery you stumble on, a quiet caf√© where time slows down. You‚Äôve built in space for those kinds of moments, and that‚Äôs where Paris really opens up. **General tip:** Resist the urge to optimize every day. Let the trip breathe. The best feedback we hear from travelers is usually something like, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see everything, but I actually felt like I was there.‚Äù",positive,positive,0.9876,positive,0.9923

(bus drivers too especially) - Dont stay at a fancy hotel (or even a hotel for that matter, in my opinion, find a panzio, which is basically a private owned motel, and book there) If youd like I can recommend some - Budapest is great at night just avoid the area around Blaha Lujza Ter I saw another comment say this and honestly i have to agree, while vienna is nice it‚Äôs only really a one day thing for me, more is unnecesary, id add another day to hungary and do this: - Get up early, and get on a train to Pecs (Leaves from keleti train station, get tickets a day before) It‚Äôs about a 2hr train ride, and it‚Äôs a small town that is absolutely incredible, it has a fort and is a completely different feel to budapest as well as having turkish influence. Make sure to see the minaret + go to a turkish tea tent. You can eat at excalibur which is an awesome themed restaurant with great food, and take a late train back.

1lphrzt,"We visited Ecuador as part of our 3 year around the world trip (currently on month 11 and 11th country). Most people associate Ecuador with the Gal√°pagos Islands. For budget reasons, we went almost everywhere *except* there this time ‚Äî we‚Äôll come back specifically for them and give them the special attention they deserve in the future. The continental part of Ecuador has *so much* to offer for all lovers of nature, hiking, and exotic vibes mixed with modern comfort. Crossing from the Peru-Ecuador border felt like travelling 15‚Äì20 years into the future. Almost every small town here could outshine the big Peruvian cities in terms of organization, cleanliness, and convenience. The people are kinder and don‚Äôt see many tourists, and even though prices are in dollars, everyday costs are much more affordable. It is also way quieter in terms of traffic, honking and music, but still it's LATAM - it's difficult to escape from the dogs, roosters and the cumbia. In the very south, around Vilcabamba and Loja, is Ecuador‚Äôs coffee region, where we spent nearly a week hopping between different fincas and trying all kinds of first-class coffee. Unfortunately, outside Europe, espresso isn‚Äôt really a thing, and the best varieties are offered only as filter coffee (this applies to every country we‚Äôve visited so far). We got tired of it, so we bought our own grinder and a portable espresso machine (Picopresso). Things are now easier and happier for everyone involved. Ecuador also produces the highest-quality cacao in the world, and in every town you‚Äôll find countless brand-name chocolate shops ‚Äî each better than the last. We stocked up with over a kilo of chocolate: we‚Äôve got ones with green olives, juniper, salt, raw cacao, passionfruit, allspice, rose, 100% pure bars, and who knows what else. The flavor combos are endless ‚Äî only your imagination is the limit. But the most amazing thing here is the *biodiversity* ‚Äî just walking around each day, you see 5‚Äì10 new species of birds and butterflies, not to mention the plants. In Mindo, we even rented a private hacienda with its own jungle ‚Äî a few acres you could freely roam and watch the birds go by undirsturbed. We managed to snap a photo of the famous toucan, as well as several incredibly interesting butterflies ‚Äî including the caligo butterfly. If you Google it now, it‚Äôll say Ecuador is a dangerous country to visit (Level 3). That‚Äôs because of drug trafficking issues along the coast, but inland there's absolutely no trouble. At every turn we‚Äôre met with kindness and politeness, and people are always ready to help if you need anything. Like in any LATAM country, without Spanish you‚Äôre not getting far ‚Äî but after 5 months on the continent, we‚Äôre at around B1 level and nothing is stopping us now. The route was: Vilcabamba - Loja - Cuenca - Banos - Quilotoa - Quito - Mindo - Otavalo Ecuador turned out surprisingly cheap, despite all the wild stuff we did: We did a 3-day trek around a volcano, sleeping in tiny villages; went whitewater rafting (level 4); drank every type of coffee and craft beer imaginable; spent 2 nights in a private jungle; and ate shrimp until we nearly burst. Worth noting ‚Äî in Quito we stayed 4 days with family friends who covered everything, but even without those 4 days, the stats speak for themselves: **Days in Ecuador:** 29 **Accommodation:** \~$327 USD **Food:** \~$403 USD **Transport:** \~$140 USD **Activities:** \~$84 USD **Substances:** \~$190 USD **Fees/Taxes:** \~$8.50 USD **Souvenirs:** \~$48 USD **Luxury:** \~$101 USD **Other:** \~$28 USD **Total:** **\~$1,330 USD** / **\~$45.90 USD per day for both people** **Next stop ‚Äî Colombia!**",positive,positive,0.9348,positive,0.9954

n0qnfbe,"My GF and I are thinking of trying to move to Europe short term (in the beginning and if we'll see that we love it, long term). A little background: Her job requires her to be on-site and she doesn't like it anyway so she'll quit, and she's contemplating on what she wants to do if and when we'll try to move. My job is hybrid and can be remote-only so I'll be ""the"" digital nomad"". We have a few ""requirements"" from the places we want to visit, and I would love some input from the community: 1. Budget - I make let's say around 6-8k$ a month after taxes. Currently our monthly living expenses where we live now (not Europe) is around 3-4k$ (including random buys, personal stuff, restaurants, etc.). We split the expenses and I need to take into account that she won't work until she finds what she wants to do so we're looking for a place that you can live on a 3-4k$ monthly budget. 2. Traveling - We want to be digital nomads to travel the world, and Europe is the closest thing to us now so we're looking at it. We want places where we can do stuff (attractions, food, etc) on the weekends or evenings. Maybe this is obvious? I don't know. 3. Transportation - We're not going to rent a car or anything like that, so at least at the start, we want to live in a metropolitan area with good public transportation that we can rely on. 4. Safety - We have enough safety issues where we currently live, and we want to escape these sort of things. Safety should maybe even be first on the list, it shouldn't even be a question. 5. Visa - obviously the countries should have a digital nomad visa, that allows my GF to join me as well. IDK if this is obvious as well, thought to mention it regardless. Tell me if you need any more context, IDK if this is enough. We've only just recently started looking at it and there's just so much to think about, it's becoming a bit overwhelming, so I thought to reach out to the community.",positive,positive,0.9908,positive,0.9942

n1s5wmb,"TLDR; I'm looking for a permanent co-hosting opportunity in Europe for my wonderful, experienced mom (60 y.o.). She want's to move BACK from US, after all the things that are going on there. Longer ver: Hi everyone, I hope this is okay to post here ‚Äì I'm looking for a long-term co-hosting opportunity for my mom somewhere in Europe (country doesn't matter). She‚Äôs 60 years old, incredibly warm, loves children and animals, and has a lifetime of experience in hospitality and event management. She holds a PhD in cultural studies and used to teach etiquette and savoir-vivre workshops. For over 20 years, she successfully ran a high-end event agency in Europe, organizing luxury events for some of the most prestigious clients and corporations. Life took a sudden turn in her 40s when she had my younger sister and, shortly after, lost her husband in a tragic accident. That period was incredibly difficult for her ‚Äì she eventually closed her company and moved to California (early 2010's), where she's been living for the past 15 years. Now, with my sister planning to return to Europe for her university studies, we think it's the perfect moment for my mom to also come back. She‚Äôs looking for a fresh start, and I truly believe she‚Äôd be an ideal fit as a permanent co-host for someone managing multiple Airbnb listings. She speaks fluent English and conversational Spanish. She‚Äôs responsible, detail-oriented, deeply kind, and knows what exceptional guest service looks like ‚Äì both from a hotel/event perspective and as a human being. If you‚Äôre looking for a trustworthy, experienced, and genuinely lovely person to help co-manage your listings (whether it‚Äôs guest communication, turnovers, problem-solving, etc.), or know someone who is, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. We‚Äôre open to any European location and various co-living/co-working arrangements. Thank you so much for reading ‚Äì happy to share more details via DM!

I think it's more common in immigrant/traditional families. For context; I work remotely for a tech company in Asia and I'm in my latest 20s. Last year I escaped for a few months to Southeast Asia, lived better, spent less, and honestly felt happy again. That experience opened my eyes, and I‚Äôve been planning to do it again this year. It's not just about pleasure; I wanna eventually leave Canada and settle somewhere else. I also have friends in Asia. My parents? Absolutely HATE it. When I lost my job later that year because they company went bankrupt (different company), they immediately blamed the whole thing on me going to Asia and said I should return and not do this thing again. Zero emotional support. Now they are saying I will lose this job because I have bad luck and should just settle in Canada and forget about these adventures. They don't even like living in Canada because of the weather and bad economy and politics, but I guess we gotta suffer together. I‚Äôm still going, their opinion won‚Äôt change my plans.

n2aqck3,"I've never had guilt about other people choosing to have different lifestyles to me. If they have opinions, they're more than welcome to keep it to themselves. If they can't manage that, then they simply don't get to have opportunities to interact with me until they learn. There's no guilt, no self-recrimination, no feeling down about it. It's just acknowledgement that, family or no, people are individuals and can't be expected to be exactly as I might personally like them to be. And that's OK. And correspondingly, I'm not somehow obliged to make them part of my life, regardless of their opinion on that. ---- Sure, it can be a little sad if someone I liked or admired doesn't want to support me to the extent that they think they have to constantly open their mouths about their opinions on my choices, but in the end that's their call. And it's my call as to who I want to spend time interacting with. Being a person I grew up with or am otherwise related to doesn't come with any privilege in that respect other than having had a much earlier introduction. I'm perfectly OK with dropping someone out of my life entirely after 40 years or more if we end up going in sufficiently incompatible directions. There's no 'Oh I could never do that because of our shared history.' They get the same as anyone else on the about-to-be-dropped list; a one-on-one, sit-down session where I lay out the problem - there's always the chance that they honestly did not know what was going on - and they get the (unspoken) opportunity to realize what they've been doing and maybe decide to change. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. If they don't, then I guess they didn't value the relationship, so there's no reason I particularly should either. There are eight billion other people in the world I could be connecting with if I particularly want a stand-in replacement; statistics alone say that there are hundreds, if not thousands of people out there who would do a better job of being whatever that person meant to me. ---- And, funnily enough, the people who thought they could *never* be dropped because they were family get really annoyed when they're told, calmly, that they've been replaced because I found someone who was just flat-out a better (friend, cousin, parent) than they were.

1lwblfu,"Been traveling full time for over a year now but the last month has been pretty rough. Been having the worst luck here in Indonesia - cliffs notes version: 5 days after coming to Bali was walking on the beach minding my own business when a dog grabbed my hand randomly and put teeth marks requiring me to get rabies shots and throwing all my plans haywire. Then I was in Gili T and my cruise that I had booked from there to Lombok was cancelled on the morning of the departure due to a busted engine. Left me scramming to make alternate plans which was really stressful. Then in Komodo when getting back an hour before my flight the volcano on Flores island decided to blow it's top raining ash down completely shutting down the airport and cancelling all flights. Again left me scramming to make alternate plans, I was stuck on Flores for 2 days as airlines were price gouging when the airport reopened. Had 14 months of relatively trouble free travel and then a whole month with a string of things going wrong. This whole episode has been really stressful to deal with but I am guessing this is part of long term travel.

And nomads, digital or otherwise, are on the fast track to this awareness. One thing I've learned over the years is to ask ""how do you do"" (or Joey's ""how you doin'"") and listen, instead of ""what do you do"". Similarly, I'm more genuinely engaged in conversations when people seek to connect with me through shared values rather than status trading such as job title, postcode, or name dropping. Social climbing and rapid box checklists have their place in a transactional society of course, and in many ways they become an easy signal of who's grown, and who's growing or trapped, leaving me more energy for those who are net contributors not net takers.

Maybe someone here can help: I'm asking for a friend who splits time between Portugal (80%), Spain (10%) and US (10%) and needs to make near daily calls on the go (not always from home or office) to / from a US number while in Portugal. Typically on the phone > 1 hour / day. They don't need data to function on their US number while outside of the US because they have active phone plans for the other two countries. Currently they use AT+T and max it out monthly ($120/month additional on top of cost of phone plan). Getting a new US phone number is doable, though annoying. But using a VOIP may not work due to call quality and call dropping issues?. They've looked at: \- Mint Mobile (would be \~$60/mo \[$20 every 10 days\], but manually have to add the ""minternational"" pass and therefore might miss phone calls, and limited to 500 call minutes \[8.3 hours\] every 10 days), saving $720/year but adding other headaches \- Google Fi (probably won't save anything because it would cost 20 cents / minute when not on wifi -- great for data tho) Also: This person currently has three phones. I can't imagine keeping three phones charged and on my person at all times. Should he get a forwarded number? The only challenge is he has to call out from a US number that is recognizable.

Make some friends, ask around, and you'll eventually find what you're looking for. It's good to just make those friends as they'll tend to direct you a bit. You don't need a lot of money to be overseas, but if you have obligations (such as debts) back home, that can be a huge burden, so I'd settle all that while you're still there. $14.00 is really low, but that's sort of the entry position these days. At that point, just enjoy the ocean or work your network. You can expect to get $20-$30 an hour once you're fully into it. I live in Da Nang Vietnam, I pay $250.00 USD a month, and I spend around $175.00 on food a week, and the best coffee in the world. I'm also a tall, fitness oriented person so I eat a lot. I've saved 10k over the last 6 months just sitting by the beach, working casually, eating food I enjoy. No stress. Money isn't everything, it's what it can buy you and if it buys you a peace of mind, that's the best.",positive,positive,0.9754,positive,0.9997

n1tsqqg,"Ingredients as listed in the post 1. Rinse the Suancai thoroughly until the water turns somewhat clear else it will be too salty, chop up the Suancai into small chunks, and dry fry them til somewhat dry. Set Suancai aside. 2. Slice the fish fillet into thin slices, rinse until clean, squeeze out the water as much as you can. Season with salt, pepper, cooking wine (optional), sichuan pepper grounds, and 1 egg white. Mix in one direction til fish slices thoroughly coated in egg white, then add 1 tbsp of corn starch, mix again til coated, and add 1 tbsp oil and mix again. Set fish aside. 3. (Optional) if you have fish bones and fish head, fry them in about 30ml of oil til golden brown, if no bones then skip. 4. Add 15g oil to pot, heat it and add chopped gingers, chilli, garlic, green onions, stir fry til fragrant, then add the Suancai into the pot and stir fry further. After a while when your room smells good, add 1L of boiling water (needs to be boiling), add salt pepper soy sauce msg to taste, and let the broth boil for 5mins. 5. Once boiled for 5mins, take out all the stuffs in the broth and set them in the bowl you want to eat in, and leave the broth in the pot, boil it again. 6. Once boiled again, turn off the heat (heat MUST be off) and put in the fish gently, do not move them too much once moved in and let them set shape. If you move them too much the coating of starch will seep into the broth and the fish seasoning will be washed away. 7. Let the fish sit for 1min, then slowly jiggle them and let them heat in the broth for another 2mins, make sure they‚Äôre heated evenly. After 2mins, take the fish out to the bowl you want to eat in, and leave the broth in the pot again and turn on heat and boil it another time. Once boiled, pour the broth straight into the bowl to cook the fish for a final time. 8. Sprinkle chopped chilli, ginger, garlic, green onions, and Sichuan pepper corn onto the broth, heat up 50ml of oil til almost smoking, and pour the oil on top of the aromatics directly.

1lwb0k2,Hi there I'm renting this landed house and have a tenancy agreement with landlord. The issue is our toilet water is too slow and flows like urine. Meaning it takes 10-20 minutes depending on the water tank water level to fill up. Furthermore our washing machine cannot be used because the water supply is too slow due to the tank water. I suggested owner to install water pump but he is mentioning it cost minimum 1.5k to install such water pump and he wouldn't have rented out the unit with the current price in first place. I would like to ask if I can enforce landlord to help install based on my tenancy agreement. This is because the water flow is very bad and not practical for us to wait so long daily.There is a clause mentioning the landlord must maintain the house in good and tenant able repair conditions such as water pipe drains and so on.

If you were to put down an entry or exit date outside of the duration of your visa, it would be denied. The 90 days is a maximum duration, you don't have to stay 90 days, and some visas allow multiple entries within that duration (if you request multiple entry). For example you could go to Vietnam for 30 days, go to Thailand (with their appropriate visa) for a few days and then come back to Vietnam for the remaining xx days and leave before your visa expires at 90 days.",negative,negative,0.8113,positive,0.8204

I recently submitted my first ESTA application, and after it was approved, I realised I had made a mistake: I had accidentally selected ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to the question ‚ÄúIs your travel to the US occurring in transit to another country?‚Äù The thing is, I‚Äôm not actually in transit. I‚Äôm traveling to the U.S. for tourism with my parents, and for their applications I‚Äôll make sure to answer everything correctly and include the address of where we‚Äôll be staying. I‚Äôm just wondering if it will look suspicious that I selected ‚Äúin transit‚Äù while they‚Äôll clearly state they‚Äôre staying longer :') What‚Äôs strange is that I‚Äôm 100% sure I selected ‚ÄúNo‚Äù originally (I even remember checking it multiple times). But I went back to edit something else in the application and I suspect the system reset some answers to their default value when I did that. I noticed something was off when the application never asked me for the address of where I‚Äôll be staying in the U.S., now I know this happens when you select ‚Äútransit.‚Äù I've since emailed ESTA Support to ask if I need to reapply or if the approved ESTA is still valid, but in the meantime I‚Äôm a bit anxious. I‚Äôve seen other people say it‚Äôs fine as long as the ESTA is approved and everything else is consistent. Has anyone else experienced this ""glitch"" or a similar issue?

I called Asiana first, and they told me that the whole ticket is handled by Hainan, so they can‚Äôt upgrade anything because it‚Äôs not under their control. Then I called Hainan, and they said they can‚Äôt make any changes to the Asiana-operated flight either. Basically, both sides are telling me they can‚Äôt help. I was able to log in to the Asiana website with my booking reference, and I can see my flight details, but I can‚Äôt make any changes to the seat. I even asked if I could do it at the airport check-in counter, just pay extra there for a better seat, and they told me no. That part really surprised me.

Likewise, as it‚Äôs a codeshare (flight has a Hainan code) then from Asiana‚Äôs perspective it‚Äôs a Hainan flight and they can‚Äôt access their systems. Someone high up at Asiana likely \*could\* upgrade you, so if you do have high status with them and ask real nicely, maybe. You are likely to be able to upgrade at check in though, check in and gate agents will have much more freedom. In terms of seat position, you can request a seat change at check in for sure, even to an extra legroom seat if they‚Äôre available.

1lva6r7,"Hi, just wanted to share some good vibes with the good community of solo travellers... The back story is that I bought a ticket to Bangkok Thailand for my visa application. I'm often a last minute mover so I booked the flight two and a half weeks ahead. It wasn't enough time so without a visa a boarded the plane as I booked another flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh (capital of Cambodia). This is not normal at all and I faced questions at every departure. The journey from Capetown to Cambodia was 39 hours... and I was almost denied entry into Cambodia. My country is listed as being able to get a visa upon arrival (it's a little more complicated though). Luckily I had an HSBC bank card on me with my name and was asked to draw $300 ontop of the $700 I had and that morning I had spoken with HSBC online to increase my daily limit to GBP1000... I withdrew the $300 and was given a visa but still had one last desk to go through before being let into the country. The officer at that last desk was grumpy and confused. Wasn't happy to let me in but called his supervisor who nodded and said it was fine. I was in. I checked into a hostel that cost $5 per night in a 6 bed dorm. As far as I can tell, there were 3 others in the room who were very quiet and considerate. The room also had AC which was nice although it got too cold and the bed only came with a sheet as it's usually too warm... I went to the ""Long walk"" at night on Sunday which had 100's of food stalls with all sorts of food... and most meals here are around $2.50... The Cambodian's are amazing at driving. They race up and down and across streets with oncoming traffic and they manage! I don't think they really care too much about what others are doing or how they look. I don't get the feeling that they care much about status unlike other countries that are obsessed with showing how wealthy or cool they are. Extremely respectful and so far, honest. So, if you're in between jobs and have some time, you might like to visit Cambodia. Oh, just remembered, I got an hour long, traditional Khmer massage for $7... incredible!

For sleeping our girls get into our sleeping bags with us, but if it's hot they're equally comfortable just lying on our sleeping bags. Depending where you are it is probably best to keep your pup in the tent overnight for fear of predators (don't know if you were thinking otherwise).

E-collar really helps when our dogs get out of sight (they usually stay pretty close though). Our girls only use the beep setting. We don't have the GPS, but there are many times we wish we did. One of our pups has wandered farther and it would have saved us lots of time looking for her.

(No shade its local/religious significance or anything) - Skip Lempuyang temple. It‚Äôs not worth spending a whole day and countless time waiting, just to get a mediocre photo. If you decide to go however, you can avoid the silly wait time by taking a similar photo on the other side with the steps visible. People usually combine Lempuyang with Tirta Empul. It‚Äôs a pretty nice park with a lot of huge koi fish and it‚Äôs worth visiting, but maybe not so much if you skip lempuyang, since it‚Äôs almost 3 hours from Ubud. If however you‚Äôre looking to do this trip, get in touch with me and I‚Äôll share our driver‚Äôs details. He was a young and eager man who spoke pretty damn good English. - Definitey walk down to Banyumala waterfall and have a swim. Breathtaking experience. You can get a scooter-taxi on the way up. Make a day trip from Ubud to combine Ulan Dani Beratan, Hamdara Gate if you‚Äôre into it and want to wait and Gitgit waterfall. Around 4.5 hrs round trip by car, accounting for traffic. - If you‚Äôre planning to go to Kanto Lampo Waterfall to get the famous photo, expect waiting times of at least 1.30 hours while in the water. Otherwise you can take quite nice photos just next to it. - Out of Canggu, Kuta and Seminyak, the latter was our favourite, but still a tourist hotspot with a mediocre beach These were just at the top of my head.

Jangan cabut like you cabut your husband/wife's wig off. 2. If you want to take home a sapling or an entire shoot, ring the bell and ask if they can spare you one.

lzw9kxn,"Baba Nyonya. In a sense it could be said as Chinese people who embraced malay culture. However, if dig deeper , they are more of the people that maintain traditional Chinese culture (even older traditions than what modern Chinese usually having) and has interesting background. Their history start from Ming Emperor sending his people to explore world, went South, found Melaka king, gave him one of the princess as gift of loyalty to China, the princess's people that follow her started their own family in Tanah Melayu, creating mix of Chinese-Malay people. Later they can be found anywhere in South direction of China like in Gajah Putih (Thailand) , India, Sumatera(Indonesia) and etc. The reason they called Baba Nyonya are because they already adapt to life in Tanah Melayu, leading them to be proud of duo culture they maintain, creating a new identity prominent in SEA until the new Chinese came (which is during China Civil War in 1927 evacuated to Southward.)They scorned the new Chinese probably of ideology differences (communism ideal when Baba like democracy) or different culture as post-civil China is undergoing a ""special"" revolution which didn't sit well with the Baba. They don't consider themselves the Chinese or Malay as they already got their proud and unique culture. Then British came, they absorb new knowledge, adept in English and become King's Chinese, become influential in Singapore and Melaka under rule of British, becoming their semi-right hand men. Well they do adapt well, I mean they bringing Buddhism first, embraced Islam during their life there and then embraced the Christian, which make British people like them more. Which Christianity brought by Portugal who come after British. So the British they were surprised ""Christians exist here?"" but delight for sure which then widespread across Malaya. They also play huge role in securing Sultan's power, basically become diplomat and peaceful bridge for both side, British and Malay. Afterward, Japan. This period render entire Baba status they built into dust as Japanese don't care who you are. look like Chinese? you are Chinese, send to the camp. Hell, they don't spare anyone. Healing period came after WW2, Baba is recovering but British decided to do all Chinese look the same. This had the Baba in the butt as everything they did just went to longkang. So Baba try to salvage whatever they can. Rebuild their birthright. However, most of later Baba generation did not do that, probably due to their poverty? Which later come to screw them back. Most people might not notice the fact that Baba Nyonya has the status of Bumiputera, However, due to political reasons and the change in social status in the regions, especially in Malaysia, Baba Nyonya has lost its prestigious status when a policy by the Malaysian Federal Government was introduced that showed all Baba Nyonya are categorized as Chinese. Sad ain't it? Some of Malays could potentially has Chinese blood in them yet they decide to cut off one of their long-term brothers and sisters all so they can have what? Higher status? Purity?

lqf0mz1,"I‚Äôm currently on an indefinite round-the-world bicycle tour, and spent two months this summer bikepacking Mongolia & wanted to share some thoughts and photos. Mongolia is definitely not a place you want to come to unprepared, especially if you want to venture further inland rather than just following the handful of asphalt roads. Only 20% of roads in the country are paved! So get yourself some wide tires and know how to repair your bike - it‚Äôs unlikely to come across a bikestore in the countryside of the least densely populated country in the world üòâ I spent majority of my time in the Altai Mountains in the far west of the country, where most locals are actually ethnically Kazakh. Since Mongolia was never part of the Soviet Union, the Kazakhs here actually managed to preserve their culture better than those in modern-day Kazakhstan. Encounters were always nice, you will be offered plenty of Airag (fermented horse milk) and rock-hard cheese. But the food isn‚Äôt the reason you come to Mongolia, it‚Äôs to experience the way of life of the nomads and to enjoy the nature and remoteness. Those things can be quite challenging at times, not only does it require one to carry food for multiple days, drink water from streams and rivers (bring a good filter!) but it also requires a sturdy tent. I had multiple nights where I had to reinforce my tent wall with my body so it doesn‚Äôt collapse, because of super strong winds. I also experienced a snowstorm in June while crossing one of the 3000m passes. One minor mishap I had was when I got a deep cut in my foot because I slipped during a river crossing - luckily I was close to a village but it‚Äôs better to have a sufficient first aid kit in case you are in the middle of nowhere. There is also little to no cellphone service outside of the settlements, so an SOS beacon could be a wise investment. In the villages you will find a pharmacy and a couple mini-markets, but don‚Äôt always expect restaurants or homestays. These small grocery stores are surprisingly well stocked, in my experience it‚Äôs easier to find what you need here than in big cities in China! After over a month in the Altai Mountains I made it to the next ‚Äúbig‚Äù city to witness the Naadam, Mongolia‚Äôs biggest annual festival. Celebrating their culture with traditional outfits and dances, as well as the ‚ÄúThree Games of Men‚Äù: Horse racing, wrestling and archery (where women also compete). It was a show that I won‚Äôt forget, and you shouldn‚Äôt miss if you visit Mongolia during summer. After skipping a few hundred kilometres of the asphalt road through the Gobi desert by bus I cycled another loop in the Khanghai mountains in the centre of the country, where the nature was similarly beautiful and slightly less rugged. It was a bit greener which meant more nomads, and a lot more livestock - yak, sheep, goats and a couple horses. I then continued my way towards Ulaanbaatar, the capital, where I got my Chinese visa for the next adventure- the Tibetan Plateau (where I am now). Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, unfortunately I can‚Äôt respond to everyone. I will post some pics from other countries I‚Äôve cycled across in the coming days. ü´°",positive,positive,0.9935,positive,0.9982

I‚Äôm a seasoned traveller and have survived robberies and gun point, tsunamis, earthquakes and terrorists. Not much phases me but there is no way I will go back to Turkey. I‚Äôm also a Tourism consultant and have seen other destinations devolve into these cesspits but they are usually isolated to a bunch of industry specific bad actors (taxis the usual culprits). Turkey seems to be seeing an ugly osmosis into all facets of tourism. As stated by other commenters these scams are widely reported and most can be avoided (YouTube, blogs etc) but who wants to go to a destination where every waking moment (and even when you are sleeping) you are on guard.

Minimum withdrawal amount was ‚Ç¨50 and charged a 10% comission fee....

lhkzure,I tested positive for COVID while in transit in Istanbul due to US new policy of 24 hour window before returning back. No symptoms but they had be go in an ambulance and put me in a shitty hospital on the outskirts of the city where they forcefully had me sign medical paperwork not in English and no access to WiFi then hooked me up to IVs. Each day they would come to my bedside with no mask and force me to pay $300 even on my credit card. Couple days in the had me do a CT scan just to be safe or make money off of me. Eventually I got WiFi so I posted on Facebook to find that my old college friend now lives in Istanbul and that I should be getting free treatment or at least $100 a night stay at the Hilton. I put him on speaker phone on whatsapp where he berated them in Turkish to the point where he filed a complaint with the ministry of health and they kicked me out of the hospital. They were supposed to discharge me with ambulance to the Hilton since I was COVID positive but nope. Anyways Google maps showed a 3.5 hour walk since I could take taxi or metro given I was still COVID positive to the Hilton which other than dodging feral dogs wasn't that bad. I paid extra each day for a COVID test with hopes of negative sooner. Day 9 I was negative but the test had a big watermark saying I was forbidden to leave the country. Later on I come to find out that they won't let you leave until 14 days and two negative tests. After day 14 I got another negative and got the F on the next flight home.

The whole ""pay max price first get reimbursed later"" flexible tariff system for Marmaray is a big lie, because to receive a refund you need to have a personalised Istanbulkard which only residents can get. These little things do create an impression that the city can't harmonise with tourists and create a place they would want to re-visit, so it tries to rip them off as much as possible on their first and only visit.

I mostly listened but hearing his views. He was actually quite critical of Erdogan yet still very proud to be Turkish. Told me to go to several stores and what prices to accept so as not to get scammed.

Such a royal pain in the butt. For her, even jokbal (pork trotters) is too ""exotic and weird"". We passed by a dakgalbi restaurant and she also refused because she's worried it'll be spicy (it's literally not...). We had a delicious kbbq dinner but she only ate plain meat and rice because she refused to eat any of the free side dishes. She sulked the whole dinner and we had to go to Subway after that. What about Korean fried chicken? Who doesn't like that?? HER. The most irritating and audacious thing happened today. We went to a Korean Chinese restaurant and I ordered my favourite jajangmyeon, my aunt ordered jjampong and cousin ordered... dumplings. Yay. Something she's willing to eat. When my jajangmyeon came, she looked at it with disgust and let out a silent ""Eww"". And at some point even said something along the lines of ""that looks disgusting"" ""you really like that?"" ...I was really annoyed and pissed at that point but I didn't want to get angry on vacation so I just said ""Yeah it actually tastes better than it looks, want some?"" She shook her head and didn't say anything else. I just found her comments so stupid and uncalled for because I spent some time on the map app searching for restaurants that has food her stupid palate can handle. Anyways we're fortunately parting ways tomorrow as I am moving to Suwon and then Busan so I can't wait to enjoy the rest of my trip eating all my favourite Korean food and she can eat all the sandwiches she want.

Hamn√∏y Pic 7-8: Village of √Ö Pic 9-10: Nusfjord Pic 11-12: Loftr Viking Museum Pic 13: Svolv√¶r Pic 14: Tjeldbergtind view of Svolv√¶r Pic 15: Henningsv√¶r Pic 16: Verdenssvaet hike, near Narvik We spent nine days in the area. Most of the stunning scenic areas start around Svolv√¶r and progressively become more impressive as you go west towards the village of √Ö at the far southwestern end of the archipelago, with about 2.5 hours driving distance between them. Some quick suggestions: 1. Getting there: Most will first fly into Oslo and then take a flight up to one of many regional airports such as Evenes (EVE, for rental car), Troms√∏ (TOS, for rental car), Bod√∏ (BOO, for ferry), or even directly to Svolvaer (SVJ) or Leknes (LKN) on smaller airplanes with more limited / seasonal schedules. 2. Good bases to stay in would be Reine / Hamn√∏y area, Leknes / Ballstad area, and Henningsv√¶r/Kabelv√•g area. These areas are central to many scenic spots and highlights. If you have the time, I would allocate 2-3 nights to each area so you can minimize driving time and explore each area in depth. 3. Weather can be quite variable. We were there in late August and had many days of rain / cloud, but we still got to do hikes and outdoor activities every day as the rain would stop and the sun came out. Be prepared with good hiking shoes, ponchos/umbrellas and a flexible, open attitude! 4. Costs: The most expensive prices are for rental cars at $125-150 per day (likely cheaper outside of peak summer season). Gas was NOK 20-25/liter (approx. US$7.50-9.00 per gallon). Restaurant entrees are US$35-45 at upscale places and $20-30 at moderate places (no additional tax / tip beyond menu prices). There are decent groceries in larger towns such as Leknes and Svolvaer where food prices are moderate and many rorbu hotels have kitchens or kitchenette. Hotel costs are in line with popular international tourist destinations at $250-500+ per night. 5. Things to do: Stunning scenery everywhere you look. Nature lover and photographers‚Äô dream. The two lane highway E10 that links the islands must be one of the most scenic drives in the world. Outdoor activities‚Äî Hiking, with very high payoff vs effort ratio. Kayaking, fjord cruises, boating, and surfing / beach in good summer weather. Culture and history, where you can learn about Lofoten fishermen way of life, colorful rorbu cabins, stockfish production and salmon farming, and even the Vikings (the museum is on the site of the largest Viking longhouse ever found) Just an amazing, unique place in the world.",positive,positive,0.9882,positive,0.9994

lyi54y3,"I‚Äôm currently cycling around the world and this past winter I spent two months cycling in Oman üá¥üá≤, a.k.a. the hidden gem of the Middle East, a country which surprised me with its natural diversity, laidback way of life & hospitality. I wanted to share some pics & thoughts. As soon as entered Oman from the UAE, I took a turn onto a small road heading into the Hajar Mountains. I was rewarded with a rugged but beautiful mountainous landscape, and butter-smooth yet empty roads. This part of the country is sparsely populated, and you will come across many more goats than humans. Despite this there are frequent drinking water dispensers on the side of the road, often even cooled! If you are looking for a challenge, search for unpaved roads or paths on your maps, as these usually lead through Wadis, which are dry river beds, resulting in short, but unimaginably steep ascents, often reaching inclines of 30%. This meant a lot of bike-pushing, which even in winter is exhausting as temperatures were still hovering around 30C. Villages are sparse but very scenic, and also felt quite conservative, often the only people speaking English were migrants, mostly from Pakistan or Bangladesh. One afternoon a Pakistani family invited me for dinner and to spend at their place, and even offered to slaughter a goat for me, which I declined. As I continued my way south and left the steep Wadi roads behind, I came across the first foreign tourists, most of them visiting the historic cities of Al Hamra and Nizwa, famous for its forts and date plantations. Here you will also find the Jebel Shams, with just over 3000m the highest mountain on the Arabian peninsula. I took a short break to rest and to do some hiking. I then made my way towards the capital of Oman, Muscat, mainly to replace my broken camping stove. Apparently there are some nice beaches around Muscat, but I only spent a day here as I cycling in cities designed for cars will never be fun to cycle in (looking at you, Dubai!). However, Muscat marked the starting point for the long journey towards Salalah, Oman‚Äôs third biggest city, and the only major one in the south, close to Yemen. The distance via the highway is about 1000km, however it crosses Oman in the centre, which is mostly a massive wasteland, with few resupply points. Instead I wanted to cycle ~1300km along the coast, where I would pass through some small cities and fishing villages, and the landscape would be a bit more interesting. Or so I thought. Shortly after I reached the North-Eastern tip of Oman and started heading south, the landscape became extremely monotonous. Most of the time the road was actually a few kilometres inland, so I couldn‚Äôt quickly hop into the ocean to cool down or relax at the beach. I was surrounded by a empty, flat land with nothing more than a few bushes and the occasional camel for the next two weeks. That was longer than planned for this stretch, reason being that during the first week I was facing strong headwinds making the ride even more challenging, physically and mentally. Fortunately two fellow German bicycle travellers were also in the region, so we met up and made the boring ride a bit more entertaining. After a few days together we parted ways and I slowly started to appreciate the solitude, reason being the lack of cars, silence, clear night skies and the fact that the headwind was gone. I started making process and soon reached the mountains of the Dhofar governorate, of which Salalah is the capital. A spectacular scenery can be found in this region, with pristine beaches on the left, steep mountains on the right, and scenic Wadis in between. In summer it is supposedly even more picturesque, when the entire landscape is green and full of life thanks to tropical storms (‚ÄòKhareef‚Äô) bringing in lots of rain. Temperatures will also drop below 30C, making it arguably the only place in Oman where one could cycle during summer, when temperatures in rest of the region reach 40+ degrees Celsius. And just like that I had made it - cycling almost the entire length of Oman. Continuing further south into Yemen wouldn‚Äôt have been wise, so I flew to Kyrgyzstan to continue my journey around the globe. Looking back, Oman is definitely among my favourite countries I‚Äôve been to. You will be surprised by its diverse landscape and warmly welcomed by the Omanis and migrant workers alike. Cities are modern, there are many cheap restaurants and free drinking water can be found at mosques. It‚Äôs also one of the safest countries in the world, making it an option for solo female travellers. On that note, I was surprised how few local women I‚Äôve come across during my two months here. Oman is quite a bit more conservative than the Emirates for example in that regard. On the flip side, this means that you will find beautiful traditional architecture instead of skyscrapers.

loqag44,"Went to Portugal this August and September with my girlfriend. It might be the best vacation we had together. We started our trip in Lisbon (Pics 1-8) where we stayed for three nights quite close the city centre with almost everything in walking distance. The city had such a laid back feel and we were dreaming about what it would be like to live here. It seemed so much less stressful than what we're used to. People stayed up late, ate great food and met friends. It was beautiful. After that we drove to the Algarve (pics 9-18) by car where we stayed nine nights mostly for the beaches. We really wanted to find a beach which wasn't too crowded and just relax in the sun. This was not as easy as we thought, but we still found one. We had dinner at a different place every night, played games on the beach, went kayaking and generally had a great time. I think we will come back some time in the future.

1f48sg1,"I spent a few months traveling in Africa with my boyfriend, and Namibia was the third country we visited. We were there from April 26th - May 7th. I love the desert so Namibia was incredible! The weather was hot but dry, low to high 90's usually. We did most activities early in the morning or late afternoon, too hot between 1-4pm to really do anything. We opted to rent our own car and self-drive, it was easy to do and definitely one of the easier African countries to take this approach. It gave us a lot of freedom to spend our time how we wanted (vs with tours), and especially during safari we could pick and could spend as much time as we wanted with our favorite animals (lions are kinda boring, give me more wildebeest! The drama). We never felt unsafe at any point on the trip. We spent 2 camping nights in Sossuvlei National Park, 2 nights in Swakupmund, 2 nights in Damaraland, and 3 nights doing self-drive safari in Etosha National Park. Each end was capped with a night in Windhoek. It was jam packed and all of it was great for different reasons! Didn't have a fancy camera with so a lot of the safari pics aren't as fancy as other peoples. Highlights included: - Enjoying desert sunsets at our campground in Sossuvlei. - Deadvlei was what inspired the trip, and it was as awesome as I had hoped. Crowds were not a problem for us. - Spent a half day doing looking for Welwitschia plants out by Swakupmund, extremely rare and can be up to 1500 years old. They're much bigger than I was expecting! - Desert elephant tracking in Damaraland. Saw a group of 14 elephants plus 3 bulls. - Seeing a cheetah hunt in Etosha after being in the park for 5 min (didn't get the catch) - Watching rhino drama at the watering holes in Etosha every night. They're so grumpy and dramatic, its like Real Housewives of Namibia. At one point we could count 15, Etosha is def the place to go to see them. We did safari in five other countries and only saw one rhino (Kruger).",positive,positive,0.9921,positive,0.9925

There was a woman sitting across the aisle from us with a little girl who was flying as a lap child. Dad was sitting right next to mom and baby. Dad ignored both of them and even snapped at them a few times. The flight attendant kept scolding mom because the child wanted to be on the floor. Dad did nothing but play on his I phone the entire flight. The child was wiggly, fussy, and bored, and I've never seen a mom look so stressed out and tired. Even though she spoke no English. I managed to communicate that I'd be happy to play with the baby so poor mom could get some dang rest. That baby eventually crawled into my husbands lap and slept on his shoulder for 8 hours, and if I had to guess, that was the first 8 full hours of sleep mom had in years. And that darling child seemed to really love being cuddled by a dad type, even if it wasn't her dad. I wanted to smack her husband. He was absolutely useless. When mom woke up, she seemed scared to see her kid sleeping on a dude (who was also dead asleep haha), I got the sense that she was not afraid for her kid, but that she was afraid my husband would yell at her. I just motioned for her to use the restroom and get something to eat, that the baby and my husband were just fine. I doubt her piece of crap spouse even noticed my husband was taking care of HIS kid for eight hours. I was glad we could help.

It's not ok and is frankly disgusting. Additionally thank you for sharing this story. Years ago I had a small stint where I worked in a hostel for about a month in Poland. The agreement was I'd check people in to the hostel and I'd get to stay there for free in the dorms. I ended up sleeping in a bunk bed next to someone who I checked in, and then he ended up trying to rob me of my laptop the next morning. The police were involved, and a fight broke out in the hostel as he was trying to leave and not get caught. He escaped by jumping out a 3/4 story building. That experience did a number on me, but it's the hardest experiences that make us grow as humans. Now you know how sketchy it can be to travel solo.

1fp3qv1,"I'm a 24M, I've spent the last five years entirely focused on building my career. I‚Äôve made solid progress, but along the way, I realized I was feeling lonely and unfulfilled. No meaningful relationships, no adventures, no new experiences. Just work. Then, in a moment of clarity, I did something impulsive. I booked a trip to Italy, planned the whole thing in one night, and stopped making excuses. Time was slipping by, and while saving money and focusing on my career got me far, I wasn't going to get my 20s back. I couldn't stand the idea of not feeling alive. The world is too amazing to just hide at home. So, I got on that flight with almost no expectations, ready to explore Rome and try solo travel. Little did I know, this trip would completely change how I see the world. At the hostel, I quickly met some incredible people. Soon, I found myself canceling my pre-planned activities to hang out with them, and it was the best decision ever. I learned that good people can turn even a simple trip into something unforgettable. I'm so glad I approached them. I'm usually too self-conscious and wait for others to approach me, which is not the best strategy... One of the best parts of traveling alone was the chance to reinvent myself. Nobody knew my past or my habits, which gave me the freedom to be a better version of myself. Being away from home let me finally grow into the person I wanted to be. I saw this girl in the common room and felt drawn to her but didn't think much of it. Later, we accidentally bumped into each other while going out for a drink, and she bought me one. We spent the whole evening together and even exchanged necklaces before returning to our rooms. The next day, we had a magical date, like a scene from Before Sunrise, and parted ways as she returned to her country. That connection made the trip unforgettable and made me think about how meaningful it is to share moments with someone. It made me think about how important it is for me to find my wife and build a life with her. I realized I'd burned out trying to be hyper-focused on success, thinking I was smarter than my peers. But we all need real experiences and connections to feel alive. This trip woke me up. I used to make excuses, like ‚Äútravel is overrated‚Äù or ""I'll enjoy it later,"" but there's no perfect moment. Now, I'm planning a 3-6 month trip to Asia. With no major responsibilities and a flexible schedule, I have little to lose and so much to gain. I want to feel alive again, and I'm tired of playing it safe, thinking I can just save it all for ""later."" Traveling has made me more social and opened my eyes to how big the world truly is. I can choose where to live and what kind of life to build. The perfectionist in me still wants to hold back, but that's not living. Life happens while we're busy planning for a perfect future. I used to fear challenges and discomfort. Now, my biggest fear is living a safe, easy life in my hometown. It's crazy how one trip can change your perspective so much. If you're thinking about going on a trip, but aren't quite sure, just go for it. This is your sign. If you can't, do everything you can to find a way to do it. Remember, on your deathbed you'll mostly regret the things you didn't do. **TL;DR:** After years of prioritizing my career, I took a spontaneous trip to Italy and discovered I'd been missing out on truly living. I made new friends, met someone special, and gained a fresh perspective on life. Success and money mean little if you don‚Äôt experience the world and create memories. If you‚Äôre hesitant to travel, just go for it. You won‚Äôt regret it. You‚Äôll return home a better person.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

After being retired for almost 4 years and looking back at my life since retirement I saw that I was very happy officiating volleyball almost 12 months out of the year but the only travel I was doing was across the country working various volleyball tournaments. With the help of a good friend, I realized that I kept putting off recreational traveling primarily because I was very hesitant to travel alone. It was at that time that I decided to make the time in my busy volleyball schedule and just give solo traveling a try. I planned a 2 week trip to ƒ∞stanbul for April 2023. About 5 days before my scheduled trip, my AirBnB host informed me they had COVID and I needed to find a new AirBnB ASAP, which I was able to do.

Everyone says they prefer solo travel because they run on their own schedule, don‚Äôt have to accommodate anyone else‚Äôs needs, etc. My real, honest answer is that I want to feel like I‚Äôm doing something right for once in my life. I feel like such a fuck up in everyday life when it comes to work, friendships (major social anxiety), school, etc. Travelling solo gives me the opportunity to prove to myself I *can* do something right for a change. Being able to throw myself into a foreign country and figuring things out on my own makes me think that maybe I‚Äôm not *completely* incompetent.

1ef58tx,"I am currently traveling in Japan solo and I recently met another interesting (very confident) traveler at a previous hostel who shared his life experience about how he became extroverted and adopted a ""don't give a f"" attitude. Basically, it all boils down to exposure therapy and he told me to have more experiences in life by challenging myself. And challenging myself I did (I have another story to tell where I went out with an older woman than me, something that was a mental block in my life, as I've always been told to go out with women younger than me). So I am in Osaka right now, contemplating going to a bar alone. This thought was daunting, but I felt I needed to do this. Initially, I chickened out and bought a drink from a supermarket to have in my hotel room. When I got back and drank half of the bottle while playing music, I realized how lame that was. Why not have the experience I wanted at a bar in freaking Japan? Summoning all my courage, I took a shower, dressed up myself and walked outside. I walked around in Osaka, saw several bars on Google maps, but did not have the courage to walk in. I decided to head back to my hotel. But then I decided to just walk into a bar. I checked out the bar and decided the vibe wasn't right. I checked out another bar a few streets down the line (on a fifth floor/speakeasy vibe) and it was empty. There was another group of people but they were in a separate room hence we didn't have interaction. I decided to go in. I just wanted to say that this was excellent exposure therapy. I sat at the bar counter by myself. I was just being myself, played a bit on my phone / responded to some messages, chatted with the bartender who was very friendly with broken English, and enjoyed some jazz music and amazing cocktail. I had a great time and it was a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I am also very proud of myself.

Immediately upon our arrival in Italy, we got surrounded by a pack of random men in the train station and didn't feel safe (initially we were just concerned about them being a gang of pickpockets, but as they kept increasing in number and tightening the circle, we became extremely uncomfortable). We ignored them as much as possible and talked to each other, loudly mentioning the police a few times before they finally dispersed enough we finally could walk away. The next day we again encountered aggressively weird men so we noped out Italy, heading to Austria, which wasn't previously on our itinerary at all. Beautiful country and we felt much safer and at ease. Things can change a lot in 25 years of course, but I wouldn't hesitate to return to Austria and would actively avoid returning to Italy at this point. Were they dangerous? Probably not, since they eventually let us leave. But it definitely soured our opinion of the country as a whole --we never made it to Rome, which we had been looking forward to.

Trip Length: 13 days Destination(s): ‚ÅÉ Tokyo (4 days) ‚ÅÉ Hakone (4 days) ‚ÅÉ Kyoto (5 days) + afternoon in Osaka Accommodation: ‚ÅÉ a nice hotel in Minato City, Tokyo ‚ÅÉ A gorgeous traditional ryokan in Hakone ‚ÅÉ A BNB in Kyoto Activities: ‚ÅÉ Tokyo: wondering the different neighborhoods and getting lost, a headspa, sitting in the parks, hunting for cherry blossoms, Tsukiji fish market ‚ÅÉ Hakone: being a hippo in my private onsen, pirate ship around Lake Ashi, hunting for Fuji views, Hakone Open Air Museum ‚ÅÉ Kyoto: temples, Arashiyama Bamboo forest, eating the best katsu curry I‚Äôve ever had in my life ‚ÅÉ Osaka: street food and walking tour Recommendations: I didn‚Äôt have too many set plans for Tokyo. I mapped out the areas I wanted to visit for sure ‚Äî Harajuku, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Yoyogi park. Each day I took the train to a different area and just wondered around. This is the way to do Tokyo. I loved allowing myself to be surprised by the city. A highlight was the biggest cosmetics store (Cosme Harajuku) in Tokyo. I purchased so many skincare products. Five months later and I‚Äôm still using my products. When researching this trip, I saw a lot of Tsukiji Fish market haters. However I loved it! I went at like 5:30 AM (thanks jet lag). I ate a bleeding fresh bowl of tuna. It was topped with uni ‚Äî first time trying it! The uni added a buttery smooth texture to this delicious rice bowl. I also sampled the strawberry daifuku. I don‚Äôt fuck with mochi like that, but it was tasty. That strawberry was the star of course. Miss Strawberry is an icon! I‚Äôm a relaxation girlie. And there are two quintessential relaxation experiences in Japan ‚Äî the headspa and the onsen. First the headspa. I‚Äôm a Black woman with natural Afro texture hair. I was nervous that the experience would be negative because they surely don‚Äôt get many clients like me. However, my masseuse was amazing. She had a translator device that we used to communicate. She asked me about how to treat my hair. I told her not to brush or blow dry it. She then gave me the best scalp massage of my life, and my hair was so soft after. Honestly shocked the products worked ok on me, but I suppose a good product is a good product. Since I didn‚Äôt need a blow dry, she used the extra time to give me a foot massage. In total, the treatment was 3 hours and a total highlight of my experience. The Hakone onsen was also fabulous. I booked a ryokan with a private outdoor onsen. I took at least four dips every day. I needed this chill few days after the chaos of Tokyo. While you‚Äôre in Hakone, I recommend the Open Air museum. It‚Äôs a sculpture museum nestled amongst the mountains. The space put me in a contemplative mood ‚Äî very Japanese, I know. I spent a few hours just wondering the space and appreciating the care they put into its curation. I‚Äôm not going to talk too much about Kyoto because this was the work portion of my trip. But I will say, I found getting up at 5 AM for the bamboo forest to be worth it. There was no one there, except me, the monks who care for the area, and a few joggers. If you do visit, please respect the forest. I saw lots of initials carved into these gorgeous bamboo trees. That made me sad, because the monks allow us to visit this beautiful space. We should leave it how we found it. My other Kyoto recommendation is to walk the Philosophers Path. It was quiet and peaceful. And at the end of the path, I found a lone cherry blossom tree that had bloomed! Feels like a metaphor for my trip. One thing I missed out on was nightlife. I heard that Tokyo has amazing nightlife. I was not feeling very social, but I with I would have joined a bar crawl. Final Verdict: I loved Japan. I was there as a kid and have overwhelming memories of Japanese people touching me and taking my photo, as the only Black person around at the time. That was over two decades ago, and things have changed a lot. I felt welcomed in all the spaces I went to ‚Äî even Hakone, where I was basically the only Black person and one of maybe five westerners. About Me: I am a 31 year old Black American queer woman. I am fairly experienced with solo travel, and am comfortable navigating new spaces.

1fe7byx,"I‚Äôm 22y Female, I came to Venice, Italy yesterday night and today is my second day in this hostel. This morning I had to reception to ask for the towel, and he gave me a towel and asked me where am I from. I said I‚Äôm Korean and he said he thought I was Chinese, and I look really sexy. I felt uncomfortable from that moment, but I didn‚Äôt want to make a scene so I just say thank you and left. I head to the lounge and worked on my laptop, and that receptionist came to put the bed sheets down to the lounge. He says that he loves me, and ask me if I love him too. I really don‚Äôt get why this person asks this so randomly to me so I just said I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. He keeps asked me if I love him and I said I have a boyfriend. He said my face looks good and asked me if I want to have s3x with him. Of course I don‚Äôt want so I strongly said no several times, and he keeps telling me he has another private room in this building and ask for having s3x with him. I neglected several time and he left after that. I didn‚Äôt tell this to the manager of this facility but I already feel so frustrated since it‚Äôs not even the other guest but the staff of this facility that I‚Äôm gonna stay for few nights. I talked with my boyfriend about this but still I‚Äôm scared of what‚Äôs going to happen, or how the owner would react. I'm afraid of retaliation. I‚Äôm going to tell this to the manager of this facility and the website that I used for making a reservation. I feel afraid about making a scene, please anyone give me advice about this situation. ________ Edited:! 14.Sep.2024 Hello, guys. Final update. Thanks for concerning and cheering for the last time. It really encouraged me a lot and helpful practically and mentally as well ü•π First, I tried to contact through booking.com, I asked for the number of owner, I contacted with that number. I asked if he‚Äôs the owner of the facility because I wanted to make sure if I‚Äôm secured and safe to talk to him about this. He said he is not (which is someone gave me a different number, not the actual number of the owner) and refused to give me the actual number of the owner. And he told me to come to the hostel in the morning to meet him. Which I thought was quite a ridiculous thing to say. After that, I saw someone left a review at google map after I post this, and the owner replied to that review to contact her. I contacted her, and she asked me about the situation and appearance of him. I told her every detail of situation and his appearance, name, etc. She sincerely apologized to me and promised me this kind of incident is never should have been happened and never going to happen anymore in that facility. She showed me a deep empathy toward this situation. And showed me thank for reaching out and report. And I got promised for the refund for whole stay. I didn‚Äôt reach out for the police since I didn‚Äôt have enough time in Italy but still think wish I would for the further incident that can be happened. So‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how it all figured out. I will not able to do this all things without your all encouragement. I‚Äôm happy that I was able to report this situation and speak up. I also want to encourage all the people to not just tolerate sexual harassment and speak up for other women. Even though I felt so frustrated to report, explain, writing review, concerning about retribution but I‚Äôm sure that it was really important and worth to speak up. I wouldn‚Äôt put any more words about that facility since I wouldn‚Äôt know how my words are going to affect. Thanks again for sharing your opinion and numerous encouragement. I sincerely hope you all be happy, peace, and safe. I‚Äôll always wish you all the luck : )",positive,positive,0.9744,positive,0.9998

They ended up napping longer than anticipated and never went back for their bags that day. They assumed since they were locked up, no worries. Wrong. We went back the following day and their lockers were open and bags/everything gone, including one of my friends entire money stash (cash and cards). They were both ready to fly home immediately thinking the trip was ruined. I talked them into staying and said I would help them with the little money I had while they stayed (they were there for 2 weeks, I was there for 3 months, but we had all brought the same amount of money with us). Turned out to be a great trip still. I depleted my savings faster than I'd planned for that first 2 weeks, but they repaid my when they got home and I was able to continue my trip for the rest of the summer.

1g1g58n,"The title is a bit dramatic but I'm having a hard time getting over some things that happened to me this summer. For context, I travelled around lots of Europe for almost 3 months and returned back to my home in Canada two months ago. Most of the trip was great, some ups and downs, I wasn't feeling all the best all the time but for the majority of it I was having a blast. I think being solo for almost all of it made me confront a lot of my inner thoughts and feelings, so trying to navigate that while changing my setting a lot caused a rollercoaster of emotions. But beyond the typical wonder of travel and exploring, I ended up having a short romance with someone on my trip (a local) and I didn't want to leave. This was near the end of my trip, so I already had my plane ticket home and things booked, plus the expiration date on my visa. But in a perfect world void of any commitments or responsibilities, I would have stayed to see how things developed. Granted, this was only a week long romance and I understand that I was in exceptional circumstances while travelling with the whole rose-coloured glasses and what not. But I haven't been able to shake my experience with this person and it has been over two months since I left their city. Being home now, I'm feeling like my life is so dull. This big trip was supposed to be something I did after I graduated university to get a bit of travel under my belt before starting a career full time. Now that I'm starting my career I just feel dread that I'm starting to work towards a life here while I feel a pull to head back Europe to live at least for a bit. I think the fact that I travelled solo for such a long time altered my brain a bit. Like if the trip was shorter, I could feel like it was a vacation, but the way that I extended it so long made me develop feelings of staying. Even if this person moves on, it's the fact that I felt like I found a place for me to flourish and be myself overseas which is something I lack at home. I had planned to wait things out and allow myself to move on but for months now I've just been in a weird state of mind where I feel sad and directionless and want to take steps towards an internship or something overseas to live there even for a little bit. I feel kind of delusional but I can't shake some feelings I have and just want to just hear from other people that may have experienced something similar.

And on top of that, you might be home sick, you will be away from all your social network and support, people will speak a different langauge, you might get discriminated and feel like you don't belong etc. Having said that, you might enjoy living abroad, but you will never know until you try.

It didn't go away for me - opposite of a 'vacation' where you're supposed to come out of it feeling recharged to keep life at home going.

lrhqf7o,"Having had a very similar experience, I have some good insights for you. This was over a year ago. Solo traveled Europe for 3 months. About half way through the trip, I met a girl who was also traveling. We hit it off, and ended up traveling a bit together for like a week. In that brief time, I felt the most love and connection I‚Äôve ever felt for anyone. When this was happening, she was at the end of her trip and had to return home (on the other side of the world from where I lived). She seemed to accept what I didn‚Äôt want to: it was never going to work. And she was right. You simply cannot and should not move to the other side of the world to be with someone you just met. When she left, I felt the emptiest I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. I was so heartbroken. If she randomly popped into my mind, my heart would hurt so badly that it was like having the wind suddenly knocked out of me, and I‚Äôd need to literally sit down. That lasted for about 6-7 months after returning home. I‚Äôve since moved on. I think about her now and then but it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much. Im even in a long term relationship now and still don‚Äôt feel the same way with my current partner like the way I felt with her in that one week. Sounds messed up, I know. But here‚Äôs why we feel this way: In the context of travel, especially solo travel, we tend to romanticize things. You meet strangers in hostels who end up feeling like your closest friends for just two days only for you to never see them again, maybe keep in touch on instagram. Everything you see and do is new and exciting and thought provoking and meaningful. The places you go and the people you meet. The same thing can happen on a romantic level. And what easier thing to romanticize than a LITERAL ROMANCE? Lol. It‚Äôs just the state of your brain fueled by the context and side effects of solo adventure. The thing you need to realize is this: You aren‚Äôt actually in love with them. You‚Äôre in love with the idea of them. Also, another solo traveler told me this when i was pouring my heart out about her. He said that he considered me lucky, as most people go through their entire lives without an experience like that. It hurts now, but life gave you something beautiful, albeit brief, and that‚Äôs something to be grateful for. Maybe this will all help a little bit, as it did for me.

It was magical in the beginning, but once we started living together and seeing how we had different life priorities and values, things went quickly down hill.

1fvkrnu,"Earlier a black women made a post regarding racism while travelling particularly from tourists. Many comments were either gaslighting her or denying her experience. I'm also a black woman and I'm also not American. I have visited countries on every continents except Antartica. I have travelled with white schoolmates, I have traveled with friends, with family, with diverse groups and solo. I have encountered intolerance and ignorance from locals at time, but the worse racism is often from other tourists. Whether it's casual racism from ignorance to straight up racism. When you travel with friends or family, it's easier to get ""over it"" because you have someone to debrief the situation. When you travel alone it's something else because you don't have a support system and you live those experiences alone and have to cope. It kind of ruin the experience... The racism is not necessarily toward me, as I have heard in the past, ""because I'm not like other black people"" but it's toward the staff, locals or anybody working in the tourism industry. It's the always thinking everyone is trying to scam, everyone is trying to steal from you and it's the blatant disregard for local customs and downgrading other ways of life. The racism might not be directed to me but it's directed to people who like me. We hear the racist jokes and the remarks that are on the border of racism. And when you solo travels, well it sucks and prevents you from creating relationships and befriending people, in other words, it excludes you. I loved solo traveling, it was such an amazing experience and I am so grateful to have live this experience. Especially visiting many countries, meeting so many people and traveling for multiple weeks. I am bless to have live those experience and I always encouraged other black women to go explore the world even if they are scared of the racism.

lq9m7z9,"I am not American nor white. The only times I've encountered racism towards black people were while traveling, when racist comments were made only by other travelers. It's always left me baffled. But come to think of it, many people, while travel, let loose of social norms and allow themselves to do things they wouldn't normally do back home. The first thing that comes to mind in this context is the concept of nudist beaches in developing countries - that many times are defined as ""nudist"" only by tourists and under protest from local communities. The same way a traveler would not just declare a nearby beach around his/her home as a nudist beach and run to the water naked in front of families and children, they would also not make any unacceptable racist comments at home. Abroad while traveling, however, no one knows us, our actions (within legal boundaries of course) don't affect us long term, we are not judged by our communities, we are free from any sociatel expectations or norms, and we all can be whoever we want and do whatever we like. Unfortunately, for some people, this means a green light to make racist comments or tell racist ""jokes"" while travel. But once they're back home and back into their communities, they can not bear the thought that they might not be the good people that they think they are and present themselves as. It's a real cognitive dissonance. And this is where, in my opinion, the gaslighting starts. Racism is real and common while traveling. Don't let anyone gaslight you into believing you're imagining it. It's important to speak up on such matters, to bring awareness, and to remind us that we all can treat each other with more kindness.",negative,negative,0.8853,negative,0.6632

1h2yrpq,"I‚Äôve been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina for the past 18 months, so began the Peru Great Divide with equal parts fear and anticipation. It‚Äôs a 1,000-mile Andean marathon with countless passes over 16,000 ft in elevation. Services faded toward nonexistence as the cold grew increasingly severe. Remote villages might have one tiendita and one comedor, otherwise you‚Äôd be lucky to pass through any given town on the same day as the vegetable truck. Atop each mountain waited torrential blizzards of horizontal snow and hail, with shards of ice collecting on my tent by morning. Just beyond Oyon I reached the new highest pass of my life: +16,300ft [4,968m]. Locals here blockaded the road in protest against mining activity, so the peak had been subsequently abandoned. I‚Äôd prepared for the cold weather, but even after months across the Andes these extreme elevations devoured my strength. It took everything I had to haul my bike over the makeshift stone walls and continue down the other side. Daylight cratered fast as I raced downhill each afternoon, but the colors up top were what struck me the most. Some peaks were sage green, some were the darkest shade of red wine, others a liquid type of orange, all ribboned with veils of ice and snow that hardly ever melt away.",positive,positive,0.9097,positive,0.9907

1ho3ojz,"I live in western NC, so it doesn‚Äôt get ADK level cold but still not uncommon for lows on the higher peaks to get into the teens at night during the winter, the valleys are just as cold. I slept next to a river recently, low of 26 degrees and I was cold as hell. I thought my gear was well equipped, but I still had cold spots in my bag and didn‚Äôt sleep well at all. What am I doing wrong? I use a double walled REI UL tent. Magma 15 down bag Thermarest NeoAir pad (r value of 4?) I slept with merino leggings on, socks and a base layer. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be okay?

m46je7k,"North Carolinian & fellow backpacker here. Your tent is fine but your sleep system does need upgrading for NC high country mtns in the winter. Unfortunately as sweet as that REI Magma is the comfort rating is ~25-30 degrees & the survival rating is 15 degrees. Majority of gender specific bags are rated different. Numbers listed for men are survival numbers where women‚Äôs bags are listed as comfort rating, being more true to the number listed. Your sleeping pad would be fine for the majority of the seasons but temps that low you may wanna look at a pad with at least an R-value of 5. I currently use the Mountain Hardwear Bishop Pass 0-degree down bag but its true rating is only 15 degree for comfort. I‚Äôve recently ordered the women‚Äôs version of the same bag but in a long bc I wanted a true 0-degree bag plus this is a great budget & performance down bag. Though women‚Äôs bags will run a little heavier they also offer more down fill being truer to those temp ratings.

m46opfq,"The river is a huge problem. This is because the real feel temp was probably 10 degrees colder than the listed temp. Just like humidity gives you a heat index temp much higher than the actual temp, it also gives you cold temps that are much colder than the actual temps. Comfort rating =/= survival rating on a bag. REI's rating of 15F is neither a comfort rating nor a survival rating. Your bag is comfort rated down to 21F. It's survival rated down to 9F. Survival rating means exactly what it sounds like - you will survive but you will be miserable. It will be too cold to sleep comfortably for most people. Your bag is at it's comfort limit in these conditions BEFORE the relative humidity/real feel temp problem of being near the river. I use Weather Underground for trip planning because they clearly map out both actual and real feel temps. If you have CalTopo, they also have a Lowest Temp in the last 24 hours map. I use this to figure out where to avoid camping. So, how to avoid this? 1. Go read Andrew Skurka's article about picking a site. Better site selection will really help. And will cost you $0 and add 0 lbs to your pack. 2. Know the real feel temps for overnight and plan accordingly. Also, know which side of the topography you are on. Over Thanksgiving, I was backpacking in Arkansas. There was about a 10F difference between the north-facing / north-exposed stream valleys and a more protected south-facing / south -exposed creek valley. This is where temp layers like CalTopo has can help you visualize how temps are interacting with terrain. 3. Understand your gear. Your bag is comfort-rated only to a real feel of 21 degrees. 4. Understand yourself. If this is the first time you have been so cold, you might not be a cold sleeper. I am a cold sleeper. I can only take my bag down to 5F above its comfort rating. Period. I can wear all of my layers including my down coat, down booties and merino wool hat. I still will not be warm enough to sleep if it is too close to the comfort rating on my bag. You can only figure this out by continuing to experiment with colder conditions. One thing I find helpful is to plan less miles per day in colder conditions. If I plan routes that allow me to get all my miles done between 11 am and 5 or 6 pm, I can safely get the sleep I need. I do this because I know that if I am close to my personal bag limit, I won't sleep well until temps warm up after 5 am. If I can get 5 hours of sleep that really helps. But that does mean I won't hit the trail at 7 or 8 am like usual. 5. Wear every layer to bed, including your rain gear. Ponchos and rain coats can act as a vapor proof layer aka VPL. This can help trap heat near your body, not allowing it to escape. Also figure out how to sleep on your pack. Lots of folks put them under their pads, under their feet. I like mine under my head and shoulders as a side sleepr. Again, you are using everything you have as insulation. 6. Adding another pad below your pad will help. The NeoAir has an R value of 4.5. Adding CCF pad below it like the Z lite with an R value of 2.0 will bring your total R value up to 6.5. A modular system like this probably makes the most sense in your case because you only have to bring the extra bulk and weight in specific cases. Try these tricks first. You are looking at $50-$60 and about a pound to your packed weight. For your dog, you might consider packing them a sweater or insulated jacket for them to wear at night on these cold trips. I am also a huge fan of how much mylar emergency blankets help with very little weight. Something like the SOL escape bivy will likely stand up to your dog's nails or being stepped on. You can throw it over them if they are sleeping on your bag. The SOL Escape bivy is $70 and half a pound. If they sleep half on or sleep beside your bag, you might want to bring an additional Z pack sit pad for them to curl up on on cold nights. The sit pad is $30 and only 2 ounces. There are really good threads about winter camping over in ultralight and within this sub if you search. Much of it will be more gear than you need. But lots of the ideas and concepts can be modified to your specific use case. With all this knowledge, the best way to figure it out is to keep doing what you are doing. Backpacking teaches us so much about ourselves because it all comes down to what we need and what works for us in the places that we explore.",positive,positive,0.9816,positive,0.9986
m47to1o,Bringing your dog into your sleeping bag will really help both of you stay warm. If you think that's too gross at least get your dog a much better insulating layer (a thick sweater that covers most of his belly and legs as well as his back and fastens snugly so he won't slip out) as well as making sure he has insulation between his body and the ground.

m1ummja,"Ended our 13 months of traveling through South America with only two short weeks in Patagonia. Since pricing was a bit higher compared to other mountain regions on the continent, we opted to just visit the highlights in the region since our budget didn't quite allow for the slow travel we usually opt for. We almost decided to skip the section since we were arriving closer to peak season(American Thanksgiving) but decided to go ahead anyway. Glad we didn't because the place is gorgeous and definitely not as crowded as we had assumed. Places visited in order of pictures: Perito Moreno Glacier(Argentina) Easy to visit from the town of El Calafate(where you would most likely fly into). There were 5 of us so we found it cheaper and easier to rent a car than to take a bus back and forth. El Chalten(Argentina) - All hikes pretty much start from town. No need for a car here. Buses run between here and El Calafate frequently. The hikes we did: Laguna De los Tres hike for Alpenglow(2am start) Laguna Torre Loma Del Pliegue Tumbado There is a new ticketing system for this part of the Argentinian national parks. Pretty much went from free hiking to $40-45 per day for hiking. The community of El Chalten isn't too happy about it since none of the fees go towards the community itself. We returned back to El Calafate to take a bus to Puerto Natales to visit the Chilean side. We based ourselves in Puerto Natales and rented a car to do day trips in Torres Del Paine. Accommodation is pretty expensive in the park so driving back and forth(2 hours each way) was a better alternative though more grueling. The plus side was we always got early starts and left late to avoid busy crowds from buses. Torres Del Paine hikes(Chile) - Base Torres (Start early, like sunrise early. This is the most popular hike in the park and it gets very busy. On the way down we must have passed a good 500+ people). Condor Lookout Cuernos lookout Grey glacier lookout Puerto Natales itself is a decent town, a bit rough around the edges but has everything you need at a decent price. Will definitely be coming back to the region at some point in the future. This is just the small popular part of Patagonia, the actual region is huge and most people don't visit it due to less logistical options. Enjoy the pics!

m1uokng,"I've just come out of a month in Patagonia. What a place! Yes, the Argentinian side is definitely more expensive, but still worth it.

Honestly, a part of me really enjoyed getting that out of the way from the get go. These images are some of my favorite captures from the first couple of days. I ended up hiking this trail with a Canon R6 Mark II and the 16-35ml EF lens. Please excuse the water mark, I've had a ton of photos stolen from Reddit, especially from r/earthporn.

lqtgugc,"My plans to hike with a buddy got pushed back so I decided to do a different hike near Tahoe on my own. Loop starting at Echo Lake Sno-Park, taking the Hawley Grade National Recreation Trail and following the TRT & PCT looping back to the Sno-Park. This was my first time doing a solo overnight. It actually didn't feel too different than hiking with my SO as we spend a good portion of the time hiking in silence anyway lol. I had sent my tent poles off for repair so I bought a $30 10x10ft tarp and a 3x8 ft section of polyethelene house wrap as a ground sheet. Worked pretty well, so I'll likely be using it again for future trips where insects aren't too much of a concern. The pitch I used was a Adirondack wind shelter using a ridgeline (5mm covered dyneema). **Stats** Day 1: 15.31 mi, +3,175 ft, 6 hours 27 min moving time Day 2: 7.85 mi, +795 ft, 3 hours 47 min moving time Left the sno-park around 9:30 am Saturday and got back around 1 pm Sunday. I was pushing the pace a bit on the first day to gauge my strength and food requirements for a similar trip I have coming up. I definitely did not take in enough calories the first day and ended up bonking pretty hard (really bad headache through the night).

1h0bdyp,"1. Language Barrier: My Chinese is close to non-existent. I used Duolingo Chinese and practised until I got to the chapter about travelling. SURPRISINGLY, those basic Duolingo phrases and vocabulary from baby level all the way until the chapter on travelling were more than sufficient to survive in China! 2. Alipay: I used Alipay EVERYWHERE. Just add your credit card to it before entering China. 3. Ordering Food in Restaurants: For ordering food in restaurants, I learned how to say this phrase in Chinese well: ""I'm a foreigner. Can I order through you?"" and they will say yes! You can use your translator app and show them the Chinese words too! Some of them spoke into a translator app on their phone or on mine. Either way, everyone was super friendly and patient to help you and translate for you. 4. Flight Booking: I bought some domestic flights through the China Eastern Airlines website. OUTSIDE OF CHINA, I couldn‚Äôt pick my seat. It kept saying, ""International flights can't select seat."" But once I got into China and connected to hotel Wi-Fi, I had absolutely no issues getting to the page to select my seat. So just buy the flight tickets first and once you're in China, visit the website and select your seats. 5. Passport Verification Issues: I had issues verifying passports on other, both in-app and on the website when I was outside of China. Once I got into China, I could verify easily and immediately! :) tripdotcom app and website work with foreign credit cards directly. 6. High-Speed Rail: Taking high-speed rail is insanely easy. Just go to the counter with a human and show them your passport. No communication needed. They know what to do. 7. Attraction Ticketing: All ticketing for attractions is done with your passport. Just bring your passport and go to the human counter. The human will either scan it or find your passport number in their device. They‚Äôre very used to foreigners showing up with passports. No communication needed. 8. Group Tours: I joined a few local group tours recommended by my hotel concierge that catered to local Chinese tourists and were all in the Chinese language. These were much cheaper than English tours (which were only private tours). No issues! The tour guides used translator apps to communicate with us, and some even added me on WeChat and sent me all the instructions there. WeChat has a built-in translator, so even if you reply in English, they know how to use it to translate it into Chinese before replying to you. The hilarious part is some other tour members really wanted to communicate with me and know where I'm from, so they added me on WeChat to text chat me during the tour with the in-built translator. 9. Solo Travel: I travelled mostly on my own and only booked day group tours recommended by the hotels after my arrival. I went to Chongqing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Wulong, and Beijing. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. 10. Food on Group Tours: The food the day group tours take you to eat is HORRENDOUS. BUT! The food I found on my own by randomly walking into local shopping malls was superb! So yeah... I guess the group tours need to profit and take you to only places they already had prior arrangements with, which in most cases aren‚Äôt great. 11. Street Food: I did not eat any street food, as a number of my friends got food poisoning on a previous trip. Not saying all street food is bad, but I had limited time and didn‚Äôt want to spend it being sick. I exclusively ate at restaurants inside shopping malls. 12. Cashless Payments: I used absolutely 0 cash. Alipay worked all the time! Yay! 13. 5G Everywhere: There is 5G like EVERYWHERE. And I mean really EVERYWHERE, even in the deepest mountain tourist attractions! I guess mobile network with strong data is everywhere even in the most remote areas, so people can pay with Alipay haha! 14. Didi for Cabs: Never flagged any cabs from the street. Exclusively used Didi. Absolutely no issues with finding pickup spots, nor communication. Once you're in China, you'll be able to download the Didi Greater China app. It's in English and works flawlessly with English names of places and recommended pickup points so you know where to walk to for waiting for your driver. The Didi Greater China app also works with my foreign credit card directly. 15. SIM Cards and Internet: I didn‚Äôt get any local SIM card. I got the Tripdotcom billion connect eSIM that had a VPN built-in. Had strong signal everywhere (see point 13) and was superfast. I even did a number of Zoom video calls in the midst of my trip and had absolutely 0 lag even when I was screen sharing. Hope this is helpful!

1g1vl4u,"Last week, I flew from Barcelona to Zurich for work, mainly to attend a marketing meeting about a new product launch. As the marketing manager, my job was to coordinate with local suppliers to ensure the smooth rollout of our new ski equipment in Switzerland. Since everything went so well, I wrapped up my tasks early and had some time to explore the city. While browsing forums, I stumbled upon a short trip advertisement on [trip.com]( for a visit to Rhine Falls, and I thought, why not? It was only ‚Ç¨57! We gathered at Sihlquai Coach Terminal in Zurich, which was super easy to find since it‚Äôs close to the main train station. Everyone was buzzing with excitement as we waited! Once we boarded the comfy, air-conditioned bus, we set off for Rhine Falls. The scenery along the way was breathtaking! The Swiss mountains and charming vineyards flew by outside the window, making me feel like I was in a postcard. When we finally arrived at Rhine Falls, I was completely blown away. This is the largest waterfall in Europe! Standing in the panoramic elevator, I was filled with excitement as I took in the view. It was incredible to see 700,000 liters of water rushing down every second, the roar was deafening, and the mist felt so refreshing against my face. I strolled along the paths, checking out different viewpoints. If you visit in the summer, you absolutely can‚Äôt miss the chance to take a boat ride right up to the falls. We also stopped by the Historama Museum to learn some fascinating history about the area. As the day came to an end, I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly the time flew by.

The key thing is that they fucking love Hawai'i. We're in the UK so it's quite a schlep over there, but they have managed to go twice and never stop talking about it. As far as I can tell the key criteria are 1. temperature reliably in the 20sC/70sF ideally in october/november 2. good clear waters for swimming and snorkling 3. solid tourist infrastructure - nice hotels with pools, all inclusives, if you want to get somewhere there's a tourbus or *easy* english-language friendly public transport BUT 3b. not just a resort island. There has to be an actual genuine non-tourist town or city, ideally multiple, to visit. 4. Stunning natural landscapes, ideally green/forest/seascapes, not necessarily to spend time in, but to enjoy from a distance e.g. in a helicopter tour or from the viewing platform of your luxury lodge. 5. Non-challenging in terms of logistics and, frankly, poverty. changing plane once at a major airport is OK, but not having to bundle on to a little sea plane or get 2 ferries to your destination after 18 hours of flying from the UK; if people come up to your on the beach begging or hassling you to buy stuff that's an instant nope, etc. A lot of places I know anything about have fallen foul of point 5 (plus ""too many poisonous animals"" for bits of Australia), while all the more luxe places like the Maldives tend to (also) fail on point 3b.

Montevideo is a curious little capital city with an edge. Full of good cafes, museums, fantastic architecture. Good shopping. Punta del Diablo and Cabo Polonio must be the most beautiful beach towns I've ever visited. I'm here just before the summer season starts and the towns are still sleepy and quiet but the weather is perfect. Beautiful clear water. At least for a traveller, the country is well organised, everything is easy to sort out, transport is very efficient. Clean and much less busy than a lot of surrounding countries. Super easy to get to from Buenos Aires and the bus network is great to get you to any coastal town. The fish is top quality. But most of all it's the vibe across the whole country. Safe, slow, chilled all across. People are incredibly friendly. I love travelling and have been around but not often do I get the feeling that I could just move somewhere. I started researching how to move to Uruguay on my second day haha. No wonder Anthony Bourdain loved it so much. That's it! If you have a few days to spare, definitely spend a few days in Uruguay.

The Albania I visited in 2021 was still holding onto its quaintness, but it seemed like highway right-of-ways were being staked out everywhere, some of its quaint natural areas were already attracting too much tourism-oriented development, and much of the once-wild coastline has been developed into hotels and resorts even in the past 3-4 years. The Taipei I visited this year seems to be rapidly gentrifying away much of its neon and grit in favour of cookie-cutter gentrification development; I still enjoyed Taipei, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt the city described by a friend who visited it in 2008. This isn‚Äôt even getting to things like war-level changes or permanent political unrest; I guess I‚Äôm just illustrating that some of the more-interesting sites and atmosphere of a place can be irretrievably lost in a short time, even without war/unrest/natural disasters. Also, just a note - India is a much ‚Äúharder‚Äù place to travel than parts of sub-Saharan Africa are.

I also spent some time with some peace corps volunteers around Vanuatu and around the South Pacific. Port Vila is a similar situation, although slightly better than Port Moresby. The best way that I can describe it is that my ‚Äúspidey sense‚Äù for a bad situation wasn‚Äôt as well calibrated for Moresby/Vila. I can easily sus out the good and bad parts in town pretty much anywhere in Latin America or Africa, but in the South Pacific the scale of the cities is so different and the culture and rhythm of life was so foreign to me that I could never get a good feel of the situation. I spent a month in South Pacific Islands, but still never got comfortable moving around the capital city without good local experience. I recommend you seek local guidance and follow their advice. Ask around with hotel and restaurant staff about what to do and where to go. The tourist attractions will be very limited, so temper your expectations. Don‚Äôt go for huge ambitious adventures.

As such, it has been rated as one of the least livable cities in the world. >There is a great deal of concern about the level of crime and civil disorder and about the ability and willingness of the police to cope. Police officers have been found to be complicit in major crime. Police brutality against minor offenders, complainants and witnesses has been the subject of criticism from the international group Human Rights Watch. >It is possible to minimise the chances of becoming a victim of crime by being aware of your surroundings, avoiding places where large groups are gathered and avoiding places where offences are prevalent. The Waigani area, particularly the area around the traffic lights and the Port Moresby Golf Club, has experienced numerous carjackings.

He described it as post apocalyptic.

There are developed areas of the city where things would look like anywhere else, and then there are slums/shanty towns where you have no business walking into. The highlanders have a bad rep. Anyone chewing betelnut might seem a bit highwired to you. Don't pick an argument with anyone. That said, I've felt much more unsafe in Latin American cities for comparison. In terms of my experience, I had forgotten about the visa requirement so on the day booked an onward flight to Manila along with making the visa application. When I was connecting in Port Moresby, I saw that it was issued, so just off boarded and walked out. Had no idea and nowhere to stay, but the airline staff helped me out and drove me to a nice B&B. That place wasn't expecting a guest but set it up for me. Another airline staff member drove me around the city for sightseeing, also took me to one of the slums and I drank there with the locals. Everyone was friendly there because I was with these guys. I'm still friends with the Air Niugini guys, and this year when I was connecting through to Solomon islands, one of them hung out with me in the transit area for 12 hours.",positive,positive,0.8986,positive,0.9992

Anytime I went on social media or called friends back home, I'd hear the same stories about the same people. I knew that what I was doing was different. This was a life most people could only dream of. However, about a month in, that facade started to break. I couldn't speak Spanish very well, and the difference in Argentine Spanish is no joke. I'd go out around 3 times per week trying to meet people, with little success. I met some fellow nomads, but no one who I was really able to connect with.

By the time I left, I was very grateful to be moving on. The beginning of my stay was like a drug, I didn't understand how I ever lived without it.

Beyond finding your favorite bars, cafes, & restaurants, or throwing back a pint on Gringo Tuesdays at the local DN/expat meetup, there's a couple of things you just have to do to get the most out of your experiences here. 1. **Learn Spanish (or Portuguese if in Brazil)** \- It will 10x the depth and surface area of your connections and experiences as a nomad when you don't have to constrain every meaningful interaction to the minority of English speakers in the area. 2. **Take Dancing Lessons** \- Dance is its own universal language.

You'd be surprised what adventures can manifest when you start dancing in the street during a street fair and have reasonable command of the local language. 3. **Find a Community-Oriented Gym -** As a slomad, there's not much of an excuse not to get in the best possible shape of your adult life, but finding gyms that already have community baked into the pie is often the secret ingredient to staving off loneliness as well.

1ev3pij,"So about a year ago, my partner and I decide to move to Barcelona because we found it was the simplest visa to get to be able to stay together, we had some friends here, and we speak Spanish, so Catalan couldn't be too hard. 1- The visa process The visa itself is SO backed up, I almost would warn against even trying anymore. I've been in the process of trying to attain mine with a lawyer since January. I am currently still stuck waiting for one of the many steps/appointments in this process made of beaurocratic nightmare fuel. I have probably sent 100-200 emails to my lawyer and and the various agencies you need to work with ,paid maybe 4-5K for the various docs and postage and steps, (background checks, diplomas, translation, apostilles). Also, I have a few appointments and a few(2-5?) months of waiting to go. You can't even make appointments early. They release them once a week and you HAVE to hire someone to make the appointment for you these days due to the backup and confusing system. By the way, all I'm trying to do Is get my fingerprints taken. It's going to take 5 months. While Waiting for this, you technically get stuck in Spain until those go through due to visa and Schengen days running out. Yes, I've been here 90 days and my time is up although I reply to my lawyer promptly and they file things just as promptly. If you want to leave, you have to make ANOTHER appointment to get a permission slip to leave/return (""regresso""). 2. Overtourism Basically, if the locals can spot that you aren't local and/or don't speak Spanish well, they resent you. I get the overtourism issues. But we were invited here, are responsible residents, and they don't care. 3. Safety This is not a safe city. I have only lived here 3 months. I have already been involved in a home robbery by two armed intruders (I was home and they came into my room!) In one supposedly nice area(Eixample). In the second incident this week in Gr√†cia, I was just attacked with one of those water guns to the face. It wasn't filled with water. I don't know what the hell was in that thing but it stung my eyes. People wax on about the ""good and bad areas"" but I purposefully stay in safer areas due to traumas I have from growing up in an unsafe area and some terrorist attacks I've been in. I cringe thinking about how much worse off I'd be if I spent more time in what[local] friends warn are dangerous areas. I'm literally thinking of moving already. I've never felt so unsafe anywhere I've lived. This city's government does not care about you, nor the Catalan people who are attacking you out of hatred. If they cared, they would make a campaign against violence, criminalise the rising water gun attacks, which is assault in some countries already, or increase the investigation and prosecution sentences of petty criminals. Nothing. Crickets. 4. The Catalans don't give a shit about your safety After I was hit with the mystery liquid water pistol, I warned others at the event to watch out, in a locals group on WhatsApp. The leader didn't ask if I was ok, they reprimanded ME in front of everyone for being racist towards Catalan for inferring to be careful ... As an illustrative point, I have tried to post in r/Barcelona about my experience and either the Mods don't let it in or they make fun of me and twist my words to make me the bad guy. A post will gain some sympathy then is quickly hit with a rapid fire downvote of hate like I've never seen. Comments are by what feels like kids. I assume they might be? 5. Renting a flat Either because of their resentment towards you or just taking advantage, their renting system makes it almost impossible to rent a flat without being rinsed with a ""foreigner fee"". I don't know if that's the same in other parts of Spain, though. Unbeknownst to some, it's illegal for agencies to charge you an agency fee... Yet most agents refuse to rent to you if you don't have a Spanish employer, unless you pay certain agencies extortionate fees (thousands of euros). So we pay the fee to have a home. They know you're only here looking for a flat as a foreigner if you're a DV or rich expat, and that you have no other option, so you pay or you are in some other extortionate agreement like the long term rentals the locals ""hate so much"". We're only here because we can't get am actual flat without paying those crazy fees. Anyways, you have the right to share your positive experience about Barcelona and defend it as a great place... but know that the locals literally don't want you to, and you aren't welcome here. So there is actually no point in defending it.",negative,negative,1.0,positive,1.0

The police were the scariest. I remember seeing an unmarked car with 4 men who were in police uniform tucked back into an alley and as I walked by I realized that they were looking very very hard at me, literal death stares. It took two days to figure out what was going on: I‚Äôm half black and half white so they were thinking I was Moroccan. The Moroccans thought I was Moroccan, they‚Äôd speak to me in Arabic first. I was denied service, hotel rooms, refused at the bank when I tried to cash travelers checks (remember those?), had rocks thrown at me by school kids while on a pay phone‚Ä¶the works. The strangest part was when they learned I wasn‚Äôt Moroccan and they‚Äôd do a 180 and were happy to welcome me and give me tips on where to go and what to see. That happened at a barber shop where they ignored me until I was literally the last person left in the shop. When they reluctantly called me over and I sat in the chair I told them what kind of cut I wanted in Spanish (bilingual my whole life) they suddenly brightened up and all the barbers gathered around to chat with me. I made it down the coast to Almeria intending to go to Morocco but right at the ferry I decided to go back to Switzerland, I‚Äôd had enough.

A factoid of uncanny interest: Re Wizard of Oz - from DEBT, a book by anthropologist David Graeber: ‚ÄúCredit Theorists have long been hobbled by the lack of an equally compelling narrative. This is not to say that all sides in the currency debates that ranged between 1850 and 1950 were not in the habit of deploying mythological weaponry. This was true particularly, perhaps, in the United States. In 1894, the Greenbackers, who pushed for detaching the dollar from gold entirely to allow the government to spend freely on job-creation campaigns, invented the idea of the March on Washington‚Äîan idea that was to have endless resonance in U.S. history. L. Frank Baum‚Äôs book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which appeared in 1900, is widely recognized to be a parable for the Populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan, who twice ran for president on the Free Silver platform‚Äîvowing to replace the gold standard with a bimetallic system that would allow the free creation of silver money alongside gold. As with the Greenbackers, one of the main constituencies for the movement was debtors: particularly, Midwestern farm families such as Dorothy‚Äôs, who had been facing a massive wave of foreclosures during the severe recession of the 1890s. According to the Populist reading, the Wicked Witches of the East and West represent the East and West Coast bankers (promoters of and benefactors from the tight money supply), the Scarecrow represented the farmers (who didn‚Äôt have the brains to avoid the debt trap), the Tin Woodsman was the industrial proletariat (who didn‚Äôt have the heart to act in solidarity with the farmers), the Cowardly Lion represented the political class (who didn‚Äôt have the courage to intervene). The yellow brick road, silver slippers, emerald city, and hapless Wizard presumably speak for themselves. ‚ÄúOz‚Äù is of course the standard abbreviation for ‚Äúounce.‚Äù As an attempt to create a new myth, Baum‚Äôs story was remarkably effective. As political propaganda, less so.

m00fyun,"One note on price. I get what you mean, Japan is more expensive than other Asian countries (except Korea maybe), but also much more developed than the rest. Since the yen dropped Japan might be the cheapest developed country out there. Just avoid Shinkansen, that's crazy expensive",negative,positive,0.654,negative,0.8503
m00qcw9,"An easy trick to make it cheaper: Stay in Osaka. You'll get there with 35EUR/n. Surprisingly Okinawa is similar in price but I personally don't recommend Okinawa that much. I repeat, Japan is cheap. But yeah if you go to the local bars it'll get expensive pretty quick. You can also just snag a beer in the convenience store to balance out the prices. Food is more expensive than the rest of Asia but the chains like Matsunoya (variant of Matsuya) provide very good quality food for barely 4-5 EUR. The only negative thing I'd say is that supporting local business is a lot more expensive than going to chains. I personally struggle more with the wi-fi. They do not have wi-fi everywhere and it can be of bad quality. I've been in AirBnB's with horrenduous wifi. The local starbucks and so on can have very questionable wifi. Many places don't even have wifi. Otherwise I think the review is quite balanced. We all have different experiences but I agree with some points I've never been able to highlight or pinpoint. Japan has variety, when you wander around you will always find new things that you would not expect. Some weird niche store, some older gentleman that wants to practice English etc. And wandering around is safe, fun, easy because of transport. Just absolutely pleasant. And yes you can hike, ski, surf, dive (it'll be pricey) etc.",positive,positive,0.9872,positive,0.9997

m00nj2m,"Since you didn't mention what you used for accommodations, I'm not 100% sure I trust your opinion. Short term (monthly) rentals have to be done by actually finding reputable LOCAL sites of companies that have furnished rentals without any contract/key/deposit requirements. If one uses Airbnb or Booking or straight to hotel (APA) instead, they can expect to overpay by 200-350%. Rental prices in this case can be ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. Without an annual contract, for example, it is hard to stay in Pattaya Thailand under $750-900/month. An equivalent room, maybe a tad bit smaller, in Tokyo can be had for the same price range. Thailand can't hold a candle to Japan, so it's pretty insane prices are similar.

m00l7y9,"Mostly agree, but my two cents: 1. Tokyo has the highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the world. I've traveled to 4 continents and Japan is the place where I've had the best food (no matter the price, even a 5$ meal). And no, using spices to cover the mediocre quality of the food or the taste of produce doesn't mean it's better outside of Japan. Obviously this is subjective, but if you feel the food in japan was bland, I don't know where you've been eating. 2. Japan isn't that expensive. Of course, if you compare it with Vietnam, it will be. If we're talking land/real estate prices, sure, very expensive (like any G-10 country). But compared to many western places, it isn't expensive or at least not THAT expensive. Food, transport, utilities have all been cheaper than in most destinations I've been to. Even most accommodation has been cheaper than in other top20 touristy countries.

m00gldi,"The two notes I'd have about Japan being expensive are 1. Japan isn't that expensive compared to North America or Western Europe (or at least, that's my experience) in terms of daily cost of living. Having said that, if you compare it to the rest of Asia, it's not so cheap. Which somewhat leads to 2. Japan isn't that expensive to live in AS A RESIDENT. But even that comes with caveats, which is to say you may not find somewhere you WANT to live within your budget, but I would contend that the fact that you CAN find something (even if not a great thing) is better than many western countries (which often don't have low budget options for single people). Basically, Japan is as expensive as your needs, and if you can survive on very little (space/etc), then you can survive on a very small budget. But again, that's not so much for travelers. Nomads are in a weird in-between area, but generally speaking the normal options for residents won't be available afaik, which means it's going to be pricey (competing with all the other tourists). Also the fruit thing is strange to me (coming from Canada/US), as the fruit here is much better/tastier than anything I can find in America. If you're comparing to the rest of SEA, then sure, but it's like saying you can get better pineapple in Hawaii than New York... it seems pretty obvious fresh fruit is more plentiful and fresher in areas where it grows natively. Japan is big on seasons... there's always going to be SOME fruit in season, it's just a matter of getting the right thing at the right time.",positive,positive,0.9612,positive,0.998

I consider myself fortunate enough to have done my backpacking in 2008-2009. I *had access* to internet, but it was something you had to seek out and pay for. I didn't have a smartphone, or a laptop so I couldn't log on to wifi. I literally had to go to an internet cafe, or nab the one computer terminal at the hostel. I have backpacked (shorter trips, a few weeks max) since, and maybe its me or maybe its the tech but: i) it feels less organic these days -you are booking everywhere in advance, you never just show up at a small town and find a hostel anymore. You also have seen or heard of most of the experiences you want to do before you get there - so they are less of a surprise to you, and can be underwhelming because of that. Before, the only real pre-cursor you had was a short paragraph in a lonely planet. No photos, and certainly no influencer videos. ii) it is less possible to disconnect from home. You are literally connected constantly to all of the people from your life at home - your parents, friends, grandparents, employers etc. It makes it more difficult to just truly live in that moment. Some of the best times in my backpacking days were just lazing around on some outdoor deck with a view of a river or soemtihg playing backgammon with random Danes or Colombians, fellow hostel guests. Or playing cards with some locals in Cambodia.

1dl9ko3,"[Screenshot \/ Article from Forbes]( Jun 21, 2024, The mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, has today announced a controversial and drastic move to get rid of all short-term apartment rentals for tourists by 2028. # Rising living costs in Barcelona The boom in short-term rental apartments in Barcelona has caused a significant increase in living costs in the Catalan capital. Many residents are unable to afford an apartment after rents have risen by close to 70% in the past 10 years, while the cost of buying a home has increased by almost 40%, Collboni said at a City Council meeting on 21 June, adding that access to housing has become a driver of inequality, particularly for young people. This has led the local government to take drastic measures to guarantee access to housing in the city, the mayor of Barcelona continued. ""We cannot permit that the majority of young people who wish to leave home also have to leave Barcelona,"" said Collboni, [according to leading Spanish newspaper El Pais]( The issue of overtourism has been a growing concern in Barcelona in recent years. # Spain, the second most-visited country in the world Spain is one of the [most-visited countries in the world]( According to a report published by Statista in June 2024, the country‚Äôs visitor numbers are second only to those of France, having received more than 85 million international tourists in 2023, a higher number than the pre-pandemic record of 83 million in 2019. Meanwhile, Catalonia, with its capital city Barcelona, was [the region of Spain that received the most international tourists in 2023]( In recent years it has become increasingly tricky to obtain permission for short-term apartment rentals in Barcelona. Since 2012, a tourist licence has been required in order to legally rent out an apartment defined as a ‚ÄúVivienda de Uso Tur√≠stico‚Äù (home for tourism use) in Barcelona for a duration of fewer than 31 days. Last year, the rules were tightened with licenses being limited to a maximum of ten tourist apartments per 100 inhabitants. In addition, the city put an end to permanent licenses for tourist apartments, instead forcing them to be renewed every five years. The local government has also been redoubling its efforts to hunt down and shutter illegal tourist rentals. Barcelona's Gothic Quarter gets especially crowded during the busy the summer season. # The war against illegal tourist apartments These measures have resulted in the shutting down of 9,700 illegal tourist rentals since 2016, while almost 3,500 apartments have been converted back into housing for local residents. Today‚Äôs move is the most drastic to date, one that the leading Barcelona-based daily newspaper [La Vanguardia predicts will result in a ""bloody judicial war""]( If Mayor Collboni gets his way, the City Council will eliminate the 10,101 licensed tourist apartments currently in the city no later than November 2028. His move, which has left the tourism sector stunned, is expected to be opposed by various players, not least the employers‚Äô association of Barcelona's tourist apartments, and will likely result in a drawn-out legal battle. Meanwhile, vacation rental platform Airbnb, which hosts a considerable number of Barcelona‚Äôs short-term rental listings, has not yet made an official [statement.Barcelona]( Announces Plan To Ban Tourist Rental Apartments By 2028 [Isabelle Kliger]( Announcement came early this afternoon via El Pais: [",negative,negative,0.8595,negative,0.9317

1dqgrcm,"Hey fellow travellers, If you're planning a trip to Thailand, you're in for an amazing adventure! Thailand is a beautiful country with vibrant culture, stunning beaches, and delicious food. Here are some essential tips to keep in mind to make your journey smoother and more enjoyable: **1)** **Respect the Local Culture-** Thailand is known for its rich culture and traditions. Always dress modestly when visiting temples and religious sites. It's also important to show respect by removing your shoes before entering someone's home or a sacred place. **2)Use Reliable Transportation-** For long distances, opt for reputable transportation options like trains, buses, or domestic flights. Within cities, consider using metered taxis, Grab (a popular ride-hailing app), or tuk-tuks. Always agree on a fare before starting your ride in a tuk-tuk. **3)Be Cautious with Street Food**:- Thai street food is delicious and a must-try! However, choose vendors that look clean and have a high turnover of food to avoid any stomach issues. Stick to bottled water and avoid ice unless you're sure it's made from filtered water. **4**)**Bargain Politely**:- Markets in Thailand are great places to shop for souvenirs, but bargaining is common. Always negotiate with a smile and be respectful. Remember, it's part of the culture and should be done politely. **5)Learn Basic Thai Phrases-** Learning a few basic Thai phrases like ""hello"" (sawasdee), ""thank you"" (khob khun), and ""excuse me"" (kor tod) can go a long way in showing respect and making local interactions smoother. **6)Keep Your Valuables Safe**:- Petty theft can happen, especially in crowded areas. Use a money belt or a secure bag to keep your valuables safe, and be mindful of your belongings at all times. **7)Stay Aware of Scams**:- Like any popular tourist destination, scams can occur. Be cautious of overly friendly strangers offering deals that seem too good to be true, and always verify information with trusted sources.",positive,positive,0.9962,positive,0.9989

Great Chinese, Taiwanese, and the most authentic Japanese food you'll find outside Japan but for a lower cost. The people are *incredibly* friendly, warm, and welcoming to visitors - especially when you leave Taipei and the biggest tourist spots. The landscape has a lot of variety for a relatively small island - rice paddies on the east, mountains run through the center, a little flatter on the west but that's where larger cities are, and beaches toward the south. The coastline in the north is also very pretty! There's history here, but you have to look a little harder to find it. Japan has incredible architecture that's been well-maintained or recreated over the years. Trains wisk you away to practically anywhere you want to go. You can feel like you're going back in time in some of the historic areas. Their landscape is stunning, hiking opportunities exist everywhere (we hiked in Taiwan, but it's more prolific in Japan). Japan is much larger than Taiwan and is so varied that we keep going back to explore new places. While there are WAY more travelers to Japan, you can get away from tourists by leaving the popular places behind (Taiwan has few tourists, especially once you leave Taipei - it rarely felt crowded to us). The Japanese, while extremely polite and helpful, are also more reserved with foreigners. Japan is more expensive than Taiwan. We made visiting Taiwan a priority because we're uncertain of its political future and we plan to return in 2025 (but tbf, we'll probably also go back to Japan üòÇ).

lgxrxvn,"There are no direct flights to Bangkok from LAX. Maybe from other west coast locations? Singapore is a cool city, but prices for hotels are steep. Singapore Airlines is one of my preferred airlines for travel to Thailand. Hong Kong is another cool city, Cathay Pacific is also a comfortable airline to fly. I‚Äôve done a few trips on China Eastern and had really long 20+ hour layovers in Shanghai. It‚Äôs a cool city, but check and make sure that Shanghai still does the 24hr transit visa for the city, or get a proper visa. Tokyo is cool too. Not as high on my list as Singapore or Hong Kong though. Others will likely have a different opinion. I‚Äôve had several business class upgrades enroute to Thailand on Air Nippon. Manila is another option. Especially as the LAX to Manila flight is only 13-14 hours. The beaches of the Philippines are beautiful; however, Manila is a city that is not a favorite. Lastly, Emirates is a fabulous airline to fly. I‚Äôve gotten great deals to Bangkok via Dubai. However, this is definitely the long way to get there. Both times I flew this route was on an A380 with a no children economy section. That makes for a wonderful flight.

A little about us: I've already been to all the places we're planning on going but it'll be my husband's first time for everything. I want to make sure he gets the best first timers experience. We're huge foodies! We eat about everything, no allergies, and high spice tolerance. This is one of the main reasons for our trip. Definitely looking for unique and authentic restaurants or street vendors that aren't too tourist trappy. We'd love to eat like the locals do. As much as we love the city life, we also really enjoy being outdoors, in the countryside, or on a beach somewhere. I know September is rainy season in Thailand so I've cut the beach destinations and will park that for another time. This is our itinerary at the moment (excluding travel days): 1. Hanoi (6 nights) 2. Chiang Mai (5 nights) 3. Bangkok (3 nights) 4. Kuala Lumpur (3 nights) Some questions: * How is the length for each destination? Too long, too much, just right? If too long, are there any recs on places we could sneak in? * Food and attraction recommendations are welcome :) * Anything we can improve on? * Should we be worried about the weather for any of these locations?",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

So I was walking around a shopping centre Lot 10 I think it was (where the Attack On Titan exhibition is) and was approached by two Indian guys. I‚Äôm bald, so they saw me and said oh man I used to be bald just like you (and proceeded to show some pictures) and he‚Äôs like I used this this and this herbal mixed with some oil and it worked for me. Now I‚Äôm stupid for even believing this, but I‚Äôm gullible I guess so I took down the information. His friend then said oh I can show you where to get it from, and he took me to this herbal store nearby (I got pictures of the place) and then spoke to the guy and long story short I paid by card and was charged 3000 RM for it. Now I know it‚Äôs probably impossible for me to get this money back but I just want to raise awareness to anyone that may be able to report it to the police and have their store taken down. Since I‚Äôm not local I didn‚Äôt know who to contact or report it to so I‚Äôm hoping someone here can do it. And I‚Äôm willing to provide any more information needed.

1l0mq9r,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm posting this anonymously because I‚Äôm still shaken, but I really need advice. Last week, I was sexually assaulted while sleeping in my room at a rented unit in Cheras. I live in a shared unit with individual rooms. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling someone kissing me and touching my chest and genitals. I jumped up and turned on the lights ‚Äî it was one of the male housemates from another room. He claimed he was drunk and ‚Äúentered the wrong room‚Äù, but I find it hard to believe. Our room layouts are very different. He even had the clarity to take off his glasses and place them on my desk before proceeding to assault me. It felt very deliberate. I went to the police the next day and filed a report. The officer said the options would be either for him to move out, or be charged and jailed. So far, he‚Äôs agreed to move out. However, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough. This wasn‚Äôt a misunderstanding ‚Äî he molested me while I was asleep. I feel extremely violated, unsafe, and traumatized. I now have trouble sleeping at night, wake up with panic, and can‚Äôt focus on my studies. My landlord has been supportive and asked if I want to move instead, and the guy offered to pay a few months of my rent as ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù if he can‚Äôt find a new place. But deep down, I feel like this isn‚Äôt fair ‚Äî he shouldn‚Äôt just walk away by paying some rent. I‚Äôm thinking of pursuing this further, but I don‚Äôt have much money as a student. I‚Äôm now asking: ‚Ä¢ What legal options do I have in Malaysia? ‚Ä¢ If I proceed legally, would I still be eligible for compensation? ‚Ä¢ Will he be listed with a criminal record? ‚Ä¢ Should I seek NGO or legal aid support? ‚Ä¢ Am I allowed to post about this publicly or will that cause issues later? If you‚Äôve been through something similar or have legal knowledge, I‚Äôd really appreciate your guidance. I just want to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone else.

Malay is a race. Since there's multiple races in malaysia, its gonna be something like malaysian malay, Malaysia chinese, Malaysian indian etc. 2) malaysian society don't put as much emphasis on beauty as much as korean society do. Don't get me wrong, beautiful people are still looked up to put not to the point people need to do plastic surgery just to be treated normal. 3) malaysian weather is warm and humid, thus outdoor activities are usually only done early in the morning or evenings. Any other time, most people prefer indoors. Therefore you will see alot of shopping malls that are far bigger with much more variety of amneties compared to the ones you find in korea. 4) be very careful of your belongings as malaysia is general not as safe as korea. Don't leave your belongings unsupervised. Be very careful of your handbag especially when you are walking beside a road as snatch thieves may snatch your bag and seriously injure you when you fall on the road. Don't leave any bags visible in a car when you parked the car because of break in. 5) be careful of scammers. Don't believe any sad story of a random stranger or a beggar you may encounter. They will invent a sad story and compel you to give em some money but in actual fact they don't need it. 6) food here is extremely varied and delicious and is usually the selling point for malaysia. Eat well here but also be careful as cuisine here can be quite unhealthy because of high fat and high sugar content. 7) since you are in university, try to mingle with the locals instead of just sticking to koreans only for the best experience. Joining clubs and societies will help you to meet new people. 8) malaysia is afterall a muslim majority nation and is still relatively conservative. Therefore try not to dress too sexily.

1kym6kq,"Hi everyone, I (late 20s) am looking to travel to Singapore/Malaysia with my parents (early 60s) for three weeks, sometime around January to March. My parents sent me an itinerary they liked the look of, and I've adapted it to add a few days where I think we could do with more time. My main question is whether it's worth doing a night in Malacca or whether we should do it as a day trip from KL? This ties in to my questions around getting around. If we went straight to KL, I assume it's easier to fly - but if we stopped for a night in Malacca, would it be best to get coaches or hire a car between there and Penang? I've read it's worth having a car for Cameron Highlands, but not sure where else we'd need it. This is what I've got so far for the itinerary - really appreciate any feedback/thoughts/comments and anything I'm really missing! Thanks! Singapore \[3 nights\] * Days 1-3: Settle in, explore, try lots of good food * Day 4: Travel to Malacca or KL **\[Malacca \[1 night - if included\]** * Days 4-5: Boat trip along the river, general explore/visit markets * Day 5: Travel to Kuala Lumpur\] **Kuala Lumpur \[3 nights (or 4 if not going to Malacca)\]** * \[Day 5: Day trip to Malacca\] * Days 6-7: City tour, Chinatown, Batu caves, Eco forest park * Day 8: Travel to Cameron Highlands Cameron Highlands \[2 nights\] * Days 8-9: Tea plantation visit, other hikes/nature * Day 10: Travel to Penang - including trip to Taipang and Bukit Merah Orang-Utan Island en route Penang \[4 nights\] * Days 11-13: Beach visit (no swimming), lots of good food, Georgetown. * Day 14: Fly to Langkawi Langkawi - 4 nights * Days 14-18: Explore island, lots of beach time- looking to snorkel/swim",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

mv0n6mg,"I just did this trip last year with my early 60's parent, but in reverse! Singapore --> flew to Langkawi --> combo ferry x grab to station x commuter train x grab to hotel (sounds like a lot but was cheap and actually very comfortable/straightforward) to Penang --> high speed rail to KL --> flight back to Singapore. My take was KL was really fun to explore and worth spending time in. We did a number of tours to learn more about the history, spent time wandering Chinatown, etc. We ran out of time to do everything there because things are a bit spread out and it can take a while with traffic to get to different parts of the city. I was talked out of Cameroon highlands and Malacca for the same reasons (if you've been, I also found Hoi An too touristy so depends on what you like). I don't regret spending more time in KL. Personally, I would skip Malacca and spend more time in KL, and if you can afford to in Singapore (those hotel prices are no joke...at least for my budget!). There was a whole half of the island/hiking/eco walks we just ran out of time for. The only other thing I would do if I had more time was the Perhentian islands on the east coast...if you're looking for great snorkeling/swimming this could be a swap out but you'd need to fly in. Otherwise, the Singapore --> Bus to Malacca --> Malacca to KL route makes sense and was one I researched. Just prepare for a loooong drive.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

We depart from Kuala Lumpur at 7PM on Wednesday, 30th April. I'm hoping to spend 4-6 days in Penang at Rasa Sayang Shangri La in Penang, mostly relaxing, eating and drinking with perhaps a day trip into Georgetown. The other potential areas to visit are an island (Langkawi/Redang/Perhention/Tioman), Ipoh, Cameron Highlands or Malacca. Obviously we won't be able to fit all of this into our time here.

If you want an island, Langkawi will be the easiest from Penang.Tioman,Perhentians etc are too far out of your way. Ipoh is great logistically but quite similar to Georgetown... great food,old buildings, temples etc. Cameron Highlands is between Penang and KL... are you interested in what there is to do there? Tea plantations, some hiking, lots of 'tourist attractions ' aimed at Malaysian tourists. Malacca is nice but also similar to Georgetown (and Ipoh) in what it offers All the places are worth visiting for me, and I've been to them all multiple times, but you only have a few days.I'd choose one in that timeframe.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

In fact, I would suggest your last 2 days or last day be at any of the resorts on Pantai Cenang (that's also where you cross to/from Rebak). And nearest to the airport. So, although it's very near, it would be best to cross back to mainland from Rebak only when you are done with the island, to maximize your time there. Kilim and the mangroves would be best together since they're near each other.

Google tells me Malaysia will be pretty quiet over those dates, but it seems Penang/Georgetown has some street festival type things we could possibly check out so I framed my itinerary around being in Penang over CNY. Regardless, we are ok just hanging out in a hotel and doing what we can. It's also possible that we could be in Langkawi over the holiday, so I'm hoping for a stronger opinion on where would be best to spend the holiday. Had to consider the weather too. Would've liked to do the Perhentian Islands over Langkawi. Additionally, heard that traffic to Cameron Highlands before a holiday will be bonkers.... We are ok with eliminating Cameron Highlands all together and then using those days for either; Malacca (before KL) more days in KL, Ipoh, or open to wherever else you might suggest. My partner and I are pretty chill travellers. We just like hanging out in other places. We like cities and good food. Smaller places are cool too. We love nature, but not to the extreme. We like snorkeling, waterfalls, hiking and pretty views. Would love to do Borneo someday, but it seemed a bit more involved than we want for this trip, I think.

The best thing *by far* about the privilege of having the time/money for a long trip is flexibility. **1.)** There will be places you fall in love with and will want to stay longer... **2.)** There will be places where the vibe just isn't happening and you'll want to move on immediately... **3.)** And most importantly there will be places you've never even heard of that you'll learn about from locals and other travellers and you'll want to detour to check them out... **Bottom line:** Make use of this wonderful opportunity and be open to spontaneity. Be prepared to get off the Banana Pancake Trail and away from the usual tourist centres every now and then. And very importantly be prepared to slow down a little and not be worried about checking boxes. Happy travels. You're going to some fabulous destinations. You're going to love it.

1lfm2fw,"HI guys, I was fired from my job last month and I decided that it is very good time to spend more time with my family. We had this little dream that one day we will just take one year off and travel around the world. The unexpected scenario made us do it quicker and travel for shorter period. We decided to travel a little bit to areas we've never been before. We want to visit a few countries which are interesting to us. However it is going to be very slow paced travelling because we've got two kids: 3 yo and 1 yo. We are aiming to find a very cozy places, with a swimming pool, quite close to nice beaches and not so far from towns or cities which we can find good food. We want to go sightseeing a little bit because we want to learn about interesting places and culture, too. So below you will find our plan and I'd love to get some feedback from you. What do you think about it, what do you suggest, what would you change and what tips do you have. Dates are more or less like those below. Those might change a little bit but not so much. We plan to stay around 3 weeks in each country. Most likely we will around 10 days in each place, so 2 places per country. 01.08 - 22.08 Vietnam We plan to stay around Da Nang. We learned that during this time central Vietnam would be the best place to stay and avoid monsoons. We are aware that we will experience high temperatures but hey - that's a part of experience. What do you suggest would be a nice second area to visit and stay? What about Con Dao? Is that a good idea to go there or rain season will ruin our time there? 23.08 - 14.09 Thailand We planned to visit Thai Gulf - Koh Samui. We are still looking for a second destination. We are also open for island hopping so maybe a different island would be recommended. 15.09 - 25.09 Malaysia This one is shorter because we want to travel to Malaysia ""mainland's"" East Coast. Which area would you recommend? 26.09 - 18.10 Indonesia We are looking for a first destination for first 7-10 days and then we will go to Bali. Any recommendations are welcome. 19.10 - 30.10 Malaysia - North Borneo I learned about Borneo a little bit and I feel like it is a place I want to visit. We want to avoid travelling with little kids as much as possible so that's why we want to stay in one or two places maximum. We know we will miss a lot because of this but we don't really care. It is a journey we want to make to experience other part of the world and come closer as a family. My questions below apply to each of the destination. Any of your suggestions and tips are welcome. 1. We want to find nice houses/villas (whatever you call it) with nice, clean standard and preferably garden and/or swimming pool. There might be some days that we won't do anything except spend time home. Do you have any recommendation on specific places? Which sites or apps would you suggest to use to find one? I know a lot of people book the hotel or house when arriving to the country of destination but I don't really want to do it that way. 2. Which things absolutely avoid in each country? I mean like dangerous events, potential scams etc. 3. Which areas do you recommend for staying in certain period of time and fitting to our agenda (nice area, beautiful beaches, a lot of things to see) 4. My wife cannot eat wheat. Basically we call it gluten free diet to make it easier. Anything you recommend on doing when visiting to avoid eating it? 5. Which food is absolutely must-try? 6. Which places in certain areas would you recommend visiting? We love nature, breathtaking views, ruins, historical building, anything culture and religion related (temples, pagodas, monuments). We are open to places that we would have to travel a little bit to see (let's say 1-2h car/bus/train drive in one direction). 7. Potential health issues - any precautions we should take? Vacs to take (I know it's polarizing topic), meds to take, insurance value you suggest. 8. Elephant sanctuary - are there any ""ethical"" sanctuaries where elephants are actually treated well and are located near areas we will be? We don't want to ride them, bath them etc. Just being near them will be enough. 9. Bugs and so on. What sprays to take to avoid mosquitoes, jiggers and so on. What to do to avoid unsuspected guests in boots, clothes, whatever. I basically hate anything that crawls so this will be a hard one for me. 10. My goal for this trip is to learn (or at least try and experience) some kind of sport, most likely a water sport like surfing or anything else actually. Is there any chance to do it while staing in places I suggested. 11. We are also thinking about extending our trip by around 1 month. We were thinking about visiting Cambodia or other closely located countries. Do you have any suggestions? tl;dr - please share your suggestions, tips and what to avoid when traveling to those countries.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mypraqt,"I can answer a few questions I think I know well 2. Near the Thai Malay border on the Thai side there‚Äôs a few provinces that are kinda dangerous not recommended for travel, it‚Äôs fine tho if u travel near the west coast across the Thai Malay border. The only other dodgy area is the islands off north east Borneo have a kidnapping risk that area is not recommended. Safety wise the scams are pretty similar to like every other country, some random ones, taxi/ tuktuk drivers telling u a place is closed when it‚Äôs not and taking u to a different place for a lot of money, scams with renting equipment and being told u caused damage when u didn‚Äôt, just stuff being overpriced, like taxis use grab or negotiate the price. Other risks are food safety so be careful with what you eat and also the traffic can be quite crazy be careful 4. U will struggle like a lot just in terms of labelling of allergens in places not being very common. Google to death 10 gluten free restaurants for every destination u end up in or cook in ur accommodation. Relying on random people with cards saying you have an allergy to not put wheat in the food would be quite risky you would probably get ill at least once but u can try that 7. U don‚Äôt need any vaccinations as just a standard tourist wandering round the regular tourist route just bug spray and also endless suncream 11. There isn‚Äôt a month worth of things to do in Cambodia but u can also go to Laos which is a very interesting country, or just book a flight outside of south east Asia if u feel like it to Hong Kong China Taiwan depends what ur nationality allows easily passport wise tbh",positive,positive,0.9731,positive,1.0

ljjowa6,"Hi! I went on a trip to Malaysia for 9 days in mid July. People don‚Äôt travel to this place from my country all that much, since there are more popular spots such as in Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan etc. This sparked my curiosity, and I decided to travel there to see what they have to offer. Turns out, I had one of the most fun as a tourist, in Malaysia! Had amazing food, great views and was able to experience how diverse Malaysia was. Only downside was how short the trip was, I wish I could experience more of this country. Here are explanations of the images posted. 1. Petronas Twin Tower! 2. Petaling Street 3. Batu Caves 4. A Hindu temple placed in Batu Caves 5. Little India Brickfields. I don‚Äôt remember the name of the restaurant, I just saw the place filled with people, and went for it. Had one of the customers look at me with a surprised face. Not sure if it was because I ordered so much food, or if I was eating it wrong. Either way I found it funny. 6. Botanical Garden, Kuala Lumpur. 7. A bird zoo inside the botanical garden. Ticket was kinda expensive, but I felt it was worth it. 8. An alleyway, can‚Äôt remember where. 9. Jalan Alor food street. It gets very busy, but easy to find a spot to eat. 10. Fruit stand near Jalan Alor, cheap prices! (Compared to where I am from) 11. Kuala Besut, near the jetty going to Perhentian Island. 12. Perhentian Island, a view from where I stayed (Villamas, great place for the price) 13. Some abandoned buildings along a hiking trail. The island I stayed in has hiking trails that covers most of the island, with several beaches, resorts and a fishing village on the trail. 14. A view on a boat I rode for snorkeling. The experience was great, with tons of colorful reefs and fishes (and sharks!), but almost threw up due to sea sickness. 15. Returning to Kuala Besut from the islands. From here I took an overnight bus to butterworth, a station right next to Penang Island. 16. Penang Island! A great place to just walk around and take in the view, and of course the food. 17. Lamb biryani in Restoran Kapitan. The place was so good I went again the following day 18. A cake cafe called Moody Cow. Tons of cakes that you can‚Äôt find elsewhere (Durian cake!). Kind of pricey, but the portion size is HUGE. The cafe entrance is kind of hidden behind vines, and is very moody inside (hence the name I guess). 19. Hokkien Shrimp Mee for breakfast, near Chowrasta Market. Broth had a very satisfying shrimp-y savory taste. 20. Bah Kuh Teh at Weh Hua Bak Kuh Teh, placed a street next to Chew Jetty. The vegetables topped with pork floss were so good, and the yam rice, dipping the fried dough into the soup‚Ä¶ I wish to eat this again. And theres so much more places, food I had that aren‚Äôt shown due to the image count limit (Ie, Nasi Kandar at hameediyah). Wish I could show it all. And I wish to return to this country again one day. But for now, I need to think of my next destination.

Perhentian island had higher food prices though, except the fisherman village, which is where all the locals live.

1l9e0es,"Hi everyone, üòä Thanks for the advice I received in the past few days. It really helped me structure a rough 3-week itinerary in Malaysia, and I'd like to get some final feedback and suggestions. ## Travel plan (flexible) - **August 19**: arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the evening - **August 20‚Äì26**: flight to Borneo, staying in the Sabah region - **August 27**: return to Kuala Lumpur - **August 28 ‚Äì September 2**: transfer to the east coast, with base on the Perhentian Islands for environmental volunteering and relaxing - **September 3‚Äì6**: last few days to be defined, either on the east coast or back in Kuala Lumpur - **September 6/7**: return flight ## Details Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, I'm considering whether to: - stay one night to rest and fly to Borneo the next day, or - take a domestic flight to Borneo directly the same night In Borneo, I‚Äôm planning to spend around 5‚Äì7 days in the **Sabah region**. I‚Äôve read that it offers interesting experiences in nature, tropical islands, jungle, and biodiversity-related activities, but I haven‚Äôt decided yet what to include. After Borneo, I‚Äôd head to the east coast, focusing on the **Perhentian Islands**. I found an environmental volunteering opportunity there and would like to spend as much time as possible. The final days are open depending on connections and your suggestions. ## Questions 1. Is the Sabah region safe? 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mxc0nna,"Malaysian here, hope you find these answers helpful. 1. Is the Sabah region safe? Generally safe. You'll find some travel advisories regarding the east coast of Sabah which used to be targeted for pirate kidnappings. Authorities have kept it under control recently but something to keep in mind. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? Lots to do in Sabah such as the Sepilok Orangutan reserve, Kota Kinabalu town, Mabul & Sipadan islands for diving, Mount Kinabalu for hiking. The problem is transportation between them which I'll get to later. 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? It seems you are going for a nature themed trip which will generally be more authentic than going to urban areas. 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? It is difficult to get around the areas of your interest, East Peninsula and especially Sabah. There are no trains or public transport. Roads are very bad in Sabah. Your best bet would be buses but those are operated by private companies and you'll want to vet through carefully to make sure they are legit. Driving or motorbike on your own at your own risk, as mentioned the roads are bad. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? I would suggest you consider Sarawak. It is more developed than Sabah but also offers a lot in terms of nature, though mostly forest based vs island based. Would be much easier to arrange transport around Sarawak. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Redang Island is a boat ride from Perhentian. Tioman is further but also noteworthy. On the mainland there are the towns of Kuala Terengganu and Kuantan. Lake Kenyir also for an inland forest reserve. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? For just a day, I'd recommend staying near the airport. Not much to do in just a day in KL and it is quite a distance from the airport. The airport train is convenient though expensive, might want to see if you feel it is worthwhile to stay in the city based on that.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mxbz5tg,"I'd be inclined to push through and get to Sabah day 1. Flights go pretty late to Kota Kinabalu from KL so if you can tie up that flight with your inbound international flight, you should get there that night.

n0bi1h0,"I‚Äôm familiar with most regions of Malaysia, but will limit my comments to the Borneo portion of your trip. Borneo is generally safe and yet to become overly touristed. It is quite a large island though, and occupied by 3 different nations. Infrastructure is not as developed as in West Malaysia, but that‚Äôs part of the charm. Given your tight schedule, I‚Äôd recommend limiting your explorations to Sabah only. This will provide you with the greatest variety of experiences to choose from, while minimizing travel time. In all likelihood, you‚Äôll arrive via a flight to KK (Kota Kinabalu). There are some gorgeous islands nearby that you can access via local boat (just be sure to note last returning boat‚Äôs time). There‚Äôs also a colorful night market in the city center. Within reasonable proximity is Mt Kinabalu, which you can climb if you desire, or simply hike in the area. You can get there on your own via bus, or take an organized day trip. If you‚Äôre keen on climbing, be prepared for much colder temperatures near the summit. Traveling by bus is slow, so to save time you could fly from KK to Sandakan. From there you could sign on (do this in advance) for a multi-day trip into the jungle along the Kinabatangan River, where you‚Äôll have a chance to spot elusive Proboscis Monkeys, Malaysian Sun Bears and Orangutans and Pygmy Elephants (the latter two not likely), and stay overnight in basic river lodges. Later, you may also wish to visit the Sepilok Orangutan and Sun Bear Rehab Centers (across the road from each other) near Sandakan. Another option from Sandakan would be be a small boat trip over rough seas to Turtle Island for an overnight and a chance to witness baby turtles hatching. If you do take this journey, don‚Äôt be spooked by armed Malaysian soldiers on the island. At this point you‚Äôll be near the Philippines‚Äô Sulu Archipelago, from which insurrectionists have been known to hail. If jungle adventures and choppy waters are not your speed, you could fly from Sandakan to Semporna (sometimes referred to as Malaysia‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Indonesia‚Äù due to the local immigrant population), and bask on the idyllic white sand beach.

I understand exactly what you mean - while I didn't feel in danger, exactly, I felt WAY better when I was traveling with a man than when I did my solo weekend trips around the country. I dressed very modestly (ie, pants and long sleeves every day) and still felt like I was getting stares all the time, some cat calling, and random men asking me to take photos with them. I didn't run into any super scary situations, but definitely felt uncomfortable on the regular in Malaysia and probably wouldn't go back, especially not solo. I basically avoided walking around on my own because of the weird vibes I was getting on the street, especially after dark. I did have one weird moment in the hotel I was staying at near Bukit Bintang - I was taking the elevator downstairs alone and two men got in. When we got to my floor, they sort of boxed me in and I had to push my way out to get out of the elevator. All in all, it was a weird experience because in some ways I felt ignored because I was a woman (ie, waiters only addressing my boyfriend, even when I was the one paying), and then in other cases I felt like I was harassed for being a woman. I somehow found my Malaysia experience to be better in Georgetown - maybe it's just a smaller and more densely concentrated tourist area, but people felt friendlier there overall and I felt more comfortable going out to night markets and tourist attractions whether or not my boyfriend could join.

It is right in the island, not the mainland). It was renovated recently & now there's a proper waiting / pickup area. So even when you arrive at 12-1AM, you may wait there, order your e-hailing (Grab, inDrive etc) to your hotel & can start fresh to explore Georgetown in the morning. If you arrive earlier, the local bus also stops in Terminal Sg Nibong. Go check RapidPenang route / schedule. 3) ETS train can be sold out really quick, make sure you book ahead.

mvuz0ug,"I was just there in March. I really loved Borneo and wish I allocated more time. Did not care for Taman Negara. Liked the Cameron Highlands a lot (just don't go on the weekends). Taman Negara was perhaps the biggest disappointment. I had 2 nights there, and by the morning after the first, I was plotting how I could cut out early to the next destination. Here's the thing about Taman Negara... the canopy walk has been closed for a while now, and will probably remain that way for a while. Other than that, a lot of the treks are similar, and you won't see much wildlife. The night tour was OK, but this is definitely not off the beaten path. If you want to leave the crowds behind, you have to commit yourself to a guided (i.e., pricey), uncomfortable, leach-filled, overnight trek. Cameron Highlands pleasantly surprised me. Yes, it's built up. Yes, it's touristy. But the scenery is spectacular, and there are multiple trekking opportunities. Keep in mind, the estimated times you see are grossly underestimated. In spite of the fact that development is encroaching on the trails, some of them are true jungle treks -muddy, difficult, and extremely steep (as in, more of a climb than a trek). Borneo is where you can really leave the crowds behind, and find those clean seas and crowd-free jungle treks where you can actually see animals. Mind you, I barely scratched the surface. But I'll say this, even a day trip to Bako National Park is extremely worth-while, where you'll have an excellent chance to see bearded pigs, proboscis monkeys, and of course spectacular scenery. Overnight is even better. I did Mt. Kinabalu, including the highest via ferrata in the world, and that was without a doubt one of the highlights (if not the highlight) of the trip. But very expensive. Did not even get to other spectacular scenery like Gunung Mulu NP. Kuching is a great town to base yourself in Borneo. Nearby you'll have access to national parks, a sanctuary of semi-wild orangutans, several local villages, and a delightful waterfront that serves as a promenade for locals. I haven't mentioned the cities so much, because you seem to not like cities as much. But I really liked the canopy walk on Penang Hill. Not crowded at all when I went, but it was a weekday on Ramadan, so YMMV. I got to see the cat-sized black giant squirrels as well as the furby-faced langurs.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

I will probably look to mix between flights and public transportation to go between cities. Recommendations on this welcome. I would love to have your help and advice with: * Where am I spending too long? * What am I missing that I should see? * Should I re-order any of the cities for better efficiency? * What's the best way to get between these cities? * Any other helpful advice you may have for me!

Alternatively, you could also from Chiang Mai do a day trip into Chiang Rai - I did this with a tour off Get Your Guide and we left early in the morning, visited the main three temples in CR, then came back in the evening. But also, it makes sense to add CR as a stopping place if you‚Äôre doing the slow boat into Laos! 2. I absolutely love Chiang Mai but gosh, 8 days is a lot. I think it would be better to adjust to 4-5 days, it‚Äôs already a slow, peaceful town and 8 days seems like it would be boring fast (as someone who has visited Chiang Mai 3 times now). 3. 7 nights in Phuket also feels like a lot. I would adjust this to 3-5. I saw in a comment you said you enjoy a slower travel pace but 7 days in Phuket, even with its best sites, is still a pretty big tourist trap town. 4.

My stay with Lub D Hostel SR was also an addition to my positive experience. Such great people and neat hostel! Offers wide array of activities and tours as well. Definitely shouldn't miss out the temples. If you're into history and temples in particular, there's more than just Angkor Wat-- literally dozens are there to explore by either foot, bike, motorcycle, tuk tuk, or even the ol' usual car. Bookings for transport from city to city (or even cross country) is available at almost every accommodation in these countries. If not, they know a reliable agency for sure that they'd be happy to share with you. From my personal experience, busses and land transportation is the best option as again, felt like flying took away some experience. It's nice to see what borders are like in different countries. Sleeper/overnight busses saves you a night from accommodation as well.

1l9dzgl,"Hi everyone, üòä Thanks for the advice I received in the past few days. It really helped me structure a rough 3-week itinerary in Malaysia, and I'd like to get some final feedback and suggestions. ## Travel plan (flexible) - **August 19**: arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the evening - **August 20‚Äì26**: flight to Borneo, staying in the Sabah region - **August 27**: return to Kuala Lumpur - **August 28 ‚Äì September 2**: transfer to the east coast, with base on the Perhentian Islands for environmental volunteering and relaxing - **September 3‚Äì6**: last few days to be defined, either on the east coast or back in Kuala Lumpur - **September 6/7**: return flight ## Details Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, I'm considering whether to: - stay one night to rest and fly to Borneo the next day, or - take a domestic flight to Borneo directly the same night In Borneo, I‚Äôm planning to spend around 5‚Äì7 days in the **Sabah region**. I‚Äôve read that it offers interesting experiences in nature, tropical islands, jungle, and biodiversity-related activities, but I haven‚Äôt decided yet what to include. After Borneo, I‚Äôd head to the east coast, focusing on the **Perhentian Islands**. I found an environmental volunteering opportunity there and would like to spend as much time as possible.

mxby7nc,"I spent almost all of my two-week Malaysia trip in Borneo! The Sabah travel advisories mostly focus on specific islands off the east coast of Sabah where there have been some security incidents in the past targeting tourists. So if in doubt you could avoid those islands. The Sabah portion of my trip was spent in Sandakan (as a base for a tour of Kinabatangan River area) and Kota Kinabalu (as a stopover before heading to Mulu National Park). Sandakan and KK are kind of odd cities in and of themselves but they don't feel particularly touristy, at least not the areas I stayed in. For seeing the Kinabatangan River area (and/or nearby-ish Danum Valley) you pretty much need to join a guided tour group since these areas are somewhat remote/wild, and the guides can find the wildlife. I saw three wild orangutans! Getting around in Borneo can be a bit impractical. On a tight schedule domestic flights unfortunately are the most reasonable option, or sometimes the *only* option. From Kota Kinabalu you could hike Mount Kinabalu if you want to. I'd have done that if I had more time. It sounds kinda intense though and is an overnight commitment. But if you like hiking it sounds probably worth it! I think there are some islands near-ish KK that you could visit and they're I think pretty far from any of the islands covered under some of the eastern Sabah travel advisories. If you add anything else to a Borneo itinerary, it might be worth considering Mulu National Park - it's more conventionally ""touristy"" in some ways but the massive caves there are unlike anything I've seen anywhere else. Deer Cave is, I think by most measures, the largest cave in the world. I stayed a night in KL after arriving and was glad I did. For a major city I thought it had a kind of relaxing ""vibe"" and great food, and I was grateful to not need to immediately get on another plane after arriving in the country.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
mxgd31i,"1. Is the Sabah region safe? There are some tourist areas within areas with poorer folk, but like any other tourist place just exercise caution with beggars and pickpockets. But it is generally safe. If you aare referring to terrorist activities, this was around 10 years ago and there hasn't been tourist related threats since. Although you'll still see some armed personnel on beaches and islands here and there. But overall it's generally safe for tourists. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? From Kota Kinabalu, go to Mt Kinabalu. It is incredibly expensive to do the 2D1N climb up due to quotas but you can still do a day trip hike around the base of the mountain from Kota Kinabalu. Alternatively you can also stay in the nearby Kundasang area (beautiful views) but it is difficult to get around without a car. From there you have some alternatives. Alternative 1 - Fly or take the bus to Sandakan. Do the 3D/2N or 4D/3N Kinabatangan cruise + Sepilok orang utan centre. Sightings of wildlife at Kinabatangan are not guaranteed so most people do 3D2N but you can still absolutely do a 2D1N trip. Then you can try to squeeze in the second alternative if you'd like. Alternative 2 - Fly or take the bus to Tawau. Then take the van to Semporna. Do the 3D2N or 4D3N island hopping hikes and dives. The main attraction is Sipadan but just like Mt Kinabalu, it is also expensive to do it due to quotas. However there are many other islands and dive spots around that are just as gorgeous. You can fly from Tawau to Kuala Lumpur. 3. it too touristy or still authentic? Yes there are lots of tourists especially Chinese, Japanese and Koreans. But it's popular because it's gorgeous (and is a known vacation spot for East Asian celebrities). 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? Grab is a ride hailing app that is used everywhere. Taxis are overpriced if you try to haggle in person but they are also on Grab and prices are more transparent there. Do not attempt to haggle with a Malaysian taxi driver, they can get aggressive. Bike and car rentals are available everywhere. There are no motorbike taxis in Malaysia. For buses, download the Easybook or Redbus app. They are mostly used in Malaysia and prices are the same as in the bus stations unlike 12goasia. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? If you have just 1 week, stick to Sabah. If you have 2 weeks, you can do Sarawak as well. If you have 3-4 weeks, then you can consider Kalimantan. I've backpacked the entire island by land except when entering Brunei, feel free to ask me anything. You might want to check out the relevant subreddits r/Sarawak and r/Sabah. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Pulau Tioman and Pulau Redang are also popular but you won't have time to fit this in your current itinerary. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? If you've never been, KL is a cool place to check out for the night, especially if you love skyscrapers. KLCC Twin towers have a nice park (and are an icon of Malaysia) and the TRX is a magnificent tower. The food in Kuala Lumpur is also underrated compared to neighbouring capital cities. If you're not a fan of big cities and malls, definitely skip. The flight from KL to Kota Kinabalu is only a couple of hours anyway so it's not too bad.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

I'd personally not spend tons of time there after Perhentian. I'd add visiting the Cameron Highlands. 7. Depends how long your flight in was.

I had to stay in one in both directions when I was headed out to scuba dive on the islands, and I made sure I was in my room before dark. It was not comfortable. That said, I found plenty of people at the hostel in exactly the same situation, so had people to go out with, and it wasn‚Äôt an issue on the buses at all ‚Äì I took public transport everywhere with no problem.

The only other addition I would make to these suggestions would be Sipadan out of Semporna if you dive. I would check the weather and season's impact on the visibility first. It is a short drive away from shore and the biomass is staggering (huge schools). There were incidents with Sulu pirates there but that has been ages and ages ago now.

1lijz39,"Hi everyone. I (21M) am headed to Malaysia next month for a short solo trip before my birthday. It's my first solo trip so I'm super lost right now and would love some guidance and input! It's an 11 day trip from 31 July to 10 August. Right now I am sort of indecisive on the itinerary because as it's my first time traveling solo and 2nd time traveling in a foreign country in general, I'm not sure if my itinerary is too packed or rushed. I'm looking for a good mix of exploration, nature, fun stuff(!!) and just relaxation. Here's what the plan is for now (my ""thoughts"" are written in Italics for the sake of clarification): # Days 1-4 (31/7 - 3/8): Kuala Lumpur * Day 1: Land in KL around 4 PM, get to hotel, freshen up etc by 6-7 PM, go out and explore. I'm thinking of booking a hotel in Bukit Bintang area so I can explore the area on day 1 and perhaps visit a few markets? * Day 2: Batu Caves half day tour + Sunway Lagoon(?) + Central Market at night * Day 3: Petronas Twin Towers + Putrajaya + Chow Kit (idk much about this but my friend suggested I visit) + National Mosque + Rex KL + Genting Highlands (??) * Day 4: *Now I'm not sure if I should stay in KL for day 4 or do a day trip elsewhere. If days 1-3 are too packed, I can spread some stuff out and move it to day 4. But if they're ok I can do a day trip somewhere on day 4 instead?* # Day 5 (4/8): Cameron Highlands * *I'm thinking of going on a day trip to Cameron Highlands on day 5. Initially I wanted to stay in CH overnight but I really want to visit Ipoh as well so I thought maybe I should do 2 day trips to both places rather than an overnight one in CH alone.* * *BUT as day 4 (3/8) is kinda free should I just move CH back one day? And then this will allow me to extend my stay in Langkawi later on in the trip? Or should I change CH to overnight from 3/8-4/8 and keep my stay in Langkawi (later in the trip) as it is?* * I'm thinking of joining an affordable tour for CH, even better if it leaves from KL. Any recommendations would be appreciated! :) # Day 6 (5/8): Ipoh * Bus from CH to Ipoh * *I know that I want to spend a day in Ipoh, but I don't really have any specific spots or activities in mind, so I was wondering which spots you guys think I should visit in Ipoh and/or any activities I can do there.* * *Again, like I said before, if I'm not doing anything in KL, I will either: (a) push everything a day back, so this trip to Ipoh will be taking place on 4/8; or (b) stay overnight in CH and this trip will take place on 5/8 as planned.* # Days 7-8 (6/7 - 7/8): Penang * Train + Car Ferry from Ipoh to Penang * *I don't have the exact day to day itinerary planned because I'm not sure how to spread out the different places I wanna visit in Penang, but I'd love to go to the following spots:* * Penang Hill * Batu Ferringhi * Georgetown (would love some recs for must do things here!) * Cheong Fat Tsz Mansion * Clan Jetties of Penang * ESCAPE (I'm indecisive about this one because I'm already going to Sunway Lagoon in KL. For those who have been to ESCAPE, would you recommend this spot? # Days 9-10 (8/7 - 9/8): Langkawi * Flight from Penang to Langkawi (?) Because I think the ferry got discontinued so flight is my only option? * *I don't have any specific spots for Langkawi, but my main aim is to just relax and maybe chill at the beach, walk around the markets that I've heard about in a few travel vlogs. I would really appreciate if you guys could recommend specific spots for Langkawi.* * *Also, echoing what I mentioned before about KL's day 4, do you guys think I should scratch off day 4 from KL and instead use that day in Langkawi, staying here for 3 days rather than just 2 days?* * 9/8 9:00 PM Flight from Langkawi to KL # Days 11: KL but not really * I'll reach KL at around 10:30 ish PM on 9/8, and my flight back to Hong Kong is the next morning at 7 AM. * *I know this probably sounds dumb, I could've booked a flight from Langkawi to HK but the flights I checked all had really long layovers in KL and none of them would bring me back to HK on Sunday night. I can't come back to Monday as I sadly will have to resume work that day, and I thought this would be a better option.* * Help: So since I will reach KL at around 10:30 but my flight to HK isn't until 7 AM the next morning, should/can I stay overnight at the airport lounge or should I just book a hotel for that night? Is the itinerary too packed or just fine? Plus should I take any places out, move anything around etc?

Yeah, they drive on the wrong side of the road, but it's really not so bad compared to other parts of SEA. Train sounds nice but it will give you way more flexibility, especially going to CH, which is very worthwhile. Three days is enough for KL, but only just. But your Day 3 looks impossibly packed. Putrajaya will be at least a half day in and of itself. Go to Batu caves by train and just do it on your own. Go early AM so that the stairs are still in shade and you don't roast completely. Go to one of the rooftop bars, starting before sunset and stay till the lights go on -amazing pictures can be had. My favorite was Satellite- less well known than some others, but that's a good thing. Superb views of Petronas towers. But the best part of KL is the food. After three days, you will not feel FOMO about missing any sights, but you will feel serious FOMO that you only had 6 lunches and dinners to choose from. Research and choose wisely. You really do want to spend that overnight in CH, especially if you want to do more than see a couple of tea plantation overlooks... like go to Flora Park or do some trekking. But make sure NOT to go on the weekend! Ipoh is worth one day, and that is including Kellie's Castle as well as some of the cave temples around Ipoh. I found these sights more worthwhile than Ipoh itself, and all of these are best reached with a car. Penang is worth at least two days. The premier sight there is Penang Hill, which you want to see on a day when there are few people, late afternoon is best, and take the canopy walk \*slowly\*. Much more likely to be rewarded with animal sightings that way. Kek Lok Si temple is very impressive. Blue Mansion is nice too, but if you see just one Mansion in George Town, make it the Green Mansion. TOP Penang has amazing views from the rooftop bar, but do NOT sign up for the pricey skywalk. Just tell them you want to go to the bar, go up there for free, get a drink, and stand right next to the tiny skywalk and get the same exact views. But most of all Penang is again about the food. Don't know if I would go so far, but some say it's even better than KL. Haven't been to Langkawi, but from what I've read, it can be squeezed in if you fly. But I would just fly back out of there.

1kt69d8,"Hi, looking for some critique of my 30 day trip from mid June to mid July. I‚Äôm mid-20s female and going solo from the UK. I enjoy trying foods, sightseeing (in cities more so than nature since I‚Äôm alone) and scuba diving (I have an open water PADI). My main doubt about this itinerary is the number of flights I‚Äôm taking because they can be quite tiring including all the security hassle. Albeit they are all quite short flights. They seem necessary between Penang > Langkawi > Phuket > Perhentian (via KL so two flights) > KK (via KL) > KL to fly home. Priority would be to keep a good diving spot and place to see some wildlife. Also feel like Penang is a must because I love Malaysian food! Phuket is included because I‚Äôve never been to Thailand and thought it‚Äôs a good opportunity to get a glimpse whilst I‚Äôm nearby. Is there somewhere I should skip or spend less /more time in. I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding the east cost of Sabah as unfortunately it is still against my government‚Äôs advice to travel there. I‚Äôve only just booked the flights so not entirely sure what I‚Äôll be doing in each place so any activity suggestions would be great please. This is what I‚Äôm come up with based on previous Reddit posts/blogs: KL 4 nights Malacca 2 nights Ipoh 2 nights Cameron highlands 2 nights Penang 4 nights Langkawi 3 nights Phuket 5 nights Perhentian islands 4 nights Kota Kinabalu 4 nights Thanks!",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

You might get tired with all of the traveling you‚Äôre going to do especially within that time frame. For Malaysia, if you‚Äôre only staying at KL, 1-2 nights is enough time to spend in the city.

mq2jyz4,"All three would be really tight. Getting into and out of Indonesia can be a pain and somewhat expensive. A couple of points. >I definitely want to do chiang mai/pai area for the ethical elephant sanctuaries and a cooking class, Northern Thailand is really interesting and definitely worth a visit. Assuming that you will land in Bangkok, I suggest flying to Chiang mai to save a day of travel. In my opinion, Elephant sanctuaries are a little overrated. Its basically a petting zoo featuring elephants. Its pretty interesting and fun to see elephants up close, but its not like you are trekking through a jungle to ""save"" the elephants. As far as cooking classes, there are plenty of classes available all over the place and to be honest, its more like something to do during a break in your travel rather than travelling specifically to do a cooking class. There is plenty of other things to see and do. >a bit of the beaches in Thailand of course, I am going to assume you are talking about Southern Thailand islands/beaches (Phi Phi, Phangan, Samui etc). They are beautiful, but it is VERY far from Northern Thailand and Bangkok. Flights from Chiang Mai to Phuket would be your best option to save time. Otherwise its about 2 days + journey by train/bus. Getting around southern thailand will also take time, distances are farther than they look on the map. >and then an orangutan jungle trek in Indonesia! Same for the orangutans in Indonesia (I am going to assume you are looking into Sumatra). Depending on how you want to do it, it ranges from ""real"" jungle treks to just a big zoo with orangutans. The real treks are quite strenuous and can be pretty pricey. Also, the real treks take up a quite of bit of time, getting to Medan, getting to Bukit Lawang, and the trek itself and then back out again. 4 to 5 days and it will be pretty rushed. A more reasonable pace would probably be a week or so. >Planning on using Malaysia more as a 3-5 days passover spot in between the other 2 countries. It seems like a lot of flights. Your home country to Bangkok to Chiang Mai to Phuket to Kuala Lumpur to Medan back to Kuala Lumpur and then back home? Basically 3 weeks is VERY tight schedule. For a nice pace, instead of cramming everything in, i would suggest passing on Indonesia and sticking to Thailand and Malaysia. You will not regret it. >Also, I feel like google is telling me some type of food poisoning is inevitable, Severe Food Poisoning, probably not, you will definitely experience travellers diarrhea. There are plenty of pharmacies available with western meds. >Seeing leeches, snakes, and some disease carrying mosquitoes when researching which is scaring me - so basically how big of concern is that?

mpytxmd,"I absolutely loved Chiang Mai and Pai, and you should definitely get out to the elephant sanctuary outside Chiang Mai! Tons of good night markets and food too, it's well worth doing a food tour. Bring some motion sickness pills for the bus ride up to Pai though! I did just want to say that as a 25F who was in Malaysia last year, the vibes felt entirely different when I was traveling solo there versus with my boyfriend, as much as I hate to say it - and this was in major tourist areas like KL and Melacca. I'd say I mostly felt really uncomfortable more than anything else - I didn't feel super unsafe per se, but I also wouldn't really want to wander around at night alone. Stuff like men overtly staring at me and taking photos of me as I walked by on the street, waiters and taxi drivers ignoring me completely and only addressing my boyfriend, etc. I had one scary moment where two men sort of boxed me into an elevator in my accommodation in KL as well. I've traveled all over Asia and the Pacific, both alone and with my boyfriend, used to locals wanting to take photos with me, ask me where I'm visiting from, etc, but Malaysia was really the only place I've experienced this and felt weird about it, despite dressing incredibly conservatively (ie long sleeve and pants all the time). I've also spent time in Muslim parts of Indo and haven't noticed the discrepancy in how females are treated like how I did in Malaysia.

mpzswjb,"The thing I may add though is that many of the beaches in Malaysia, and then especially on the eastcoast islands, like Perhentian or some of the smaller islands, are to my taste better than the ones in Thailand. If beaches is the thing in southern Thailand then Malaysia is just as good or even sometimes better. At those islands it's also compleatly diffrent from the mainland. Sooo many solo woman travellers there. Otherwise Sabah, which has a big chinese population are also less conservative and also has some orangutangs at least as it is on northern Borneo. Some places in Indonesia and Malaysia would be better to skip as a solo woman traveler but certainly not all parts of those countries. Indonesia is great but at least I think it would be very stressful to add Indonesia to the trip as the best parts are either in the very far east (at least if one likes corals), the Kalimantan (at least for Orangutangs) and Bali, if not Lombok, Flores and the Komodo, is even if beautiful and not bad for solo woman traveler both far away as the others and still just very touristy with beaches that can't compare with the best ones in Malaysia, Thailand or the Phillipines. Vietnam may be an option, but in the end, why are names of countries important? Is it to count countries you havebeen to or is it the experiences you'll get and places you'll see? There are plenty better options to see much diffrent things than just ruch around to countries quiet far from eachother.

However, buses within Thailand are relatively cheap so I would definitely opt for them instead of any internal flights. I preferred the north and personally felt the islands were a bit of a let down (reminded me of Brits abroad and seriously could‚Äôve been in Benidorm), if you‚Äôre short on time I would suggest beaching elsewhere. Research your hostels! If you‚Äôre not a huge drinker then don‚Äôt go for a party one. I‚Äôd also suggest booking tours through your hostels too as they‚Äôll most likely be cheaper than Viator etc. plus you‚Äôll be with people you‚Äôve already met.

Lots of snorkeling, SUP, swimming, jungle trekking. I wrote two blog articles about the Perhentians. Check them out. I will write some more but I work fulltime so I did not manage yet. For the Orangutan, consider Malaysia too, especially Borneo. I booked Borneo exactly for this reason for July. Will report back how it was, haha! Check Sandakan and Sepilok. They have the big orangutan centers there but they also offer a lot of jungle hikes to see them in the wild. I loved Java in Indonesia a lot. Here are some suggestions what to do in Java Btw, I am also a female solo traveler and I found both Malaysia and Indonesia very safe. I never had an issue. The men sometimes try it (why not?) but in a very polite way and accept a no much much faster than Western men. Both are mainly muslim countries. Respect their culture, dress appropriately. They are very tolerant towards tourists but locals appreciate it, if you dress modestly, means, cover knees and shoulders, not too much cleavage and just let the string bikini at home. It's better anyway to wear long and light clothing in tropical places. Protects of the sun and bugs. I did catch food poisoning once. No idea from where I got it. It was a miracle that I only had it once, given that I ate in very dodgy places. So far I only got a few mosquito bites that were a bit itchy.

Your Plan sounds very nice, though I agree with others that u are on a tight schedule ^^. Just one thing to add: Check the weather!!!! Rain season (Monsun) is not just a lot of rain. It heavily impacts day to day life, for tourist and native. Sumatra for example experiences heavy flooding and earth slides from October through February. I was there last year in April and that was still very dangerous sometimes. Monsun will make it impossible to do Jungle tracks and see wildlife. Most tracks are even closed completely during rain season. U should be fine in North Thailand, though rain season is also commencing there, just not that heavily.

As George town looks great, as does Penang hill, as well as the national park with the forrest and beaches. So i'd probably catch a cheap flight there for 3 nights And then flying back to KL for a night before my flight back home I have a few main questions. 1. Has anybody recently travelled from KL to the rainforest? (Kuala Tahan), if so, would they be kind enough to detail their route and specifically what companies were reliable etc 2. Those who have been, is it fairly easy to catch activities / tours when in the town? As I have not yet arranged through my hotel. 3. Those who have been to Malaysia for a similar length trip, how was your itinery, is there anything you suggest I omit / put in instead? What did you particularly enjoy?

1k2aew4,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôm planing on a 10 days solo trip to Malaysia in June. I plan to begin from Penang, Georgetown, Cameron Highlands, KL, Malacca, Johor Bahru, and either end my trip in Singapore or detour to Kuching and end there. A bit about me: I‚Äôm travelling alone at age 17. This means I‚Äôm not yet considered to be an adult (and I know I can only stay in Airbnb and hostels but not in hotels during the trip due to my age). I‚Äôve traveled solo before (to Hong Kong), so I have some experience, but I still want to make sure I stay safe on this trip. I might not want to go too deep into the wild and do too much of hiking or diving this time, but I would definitely love to save those experiences to my future trips. I am more interested in the cultural stuff, beaches, and some mild nature vibe this time. I prefer public transportation to move from place to place. I also want to slow down my pace and stay in a place for longer. Also, I have already been to Singapore before with my family, so if I finally decide to end my trip in Singapore, it would only be a one day or half day stay so it won‚Äôt take much time. My questions: 1. Are there any important things I should know about traveling alone in Malaysia at 17? Are there any age-related restrictions I should be aware of? 2. Should I consider removing any places to give myself more flexibility? Is Johor Bahru worth visiting? I don‚Äôt see many people mentioning this place. 3. Are there any other places in Malaysia that might fit my interests and are not included in my plan yet? 4. Any other advice you wanna give me! Thx!!",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

Food: i recommend ordering a bunch of stuff to try at any big enough food centre (maxwell, bukit timah interim food centre, bedok 85 market if you're curious about local residential areas). Pizza: goldenroy; dim sum: Swee Choon, both at Jalan Besar, which is a pretty nice area for local vibes too. Nature: east coast park, you can rent a bike and cycle all the way to marina bay. Marina barrage on a windy night is amazing. Any reservoir: macritchie, lower peirce, bedok. Hike at tree top walk, bukit timah rail corridor, bukit timah hill, etc., you can see trails on google maps / nparks website. There's also coney island, pulau ubin. Education: national gallery (plenty of seats to chill too), lee kong chian natural history museum (at NUS), lee kong chian reference library. Bird paradise.

Nam Sing itself - personally isn't to my liking for a plate hokkien mee. Would recommend at least Youfu - they have an outlet at Chinatown Point hawker centre which is also a huge hawker centre with decent offering of food selection.

MY (just been back from a solo visiting Malacca, KL, Ipoh, Penang) Malacca: good place to try nonya/peranakan food. Personally think that 1 night will be sufficient. KL: must visit ICC Pudu - they got some good selection of food stuff! Try Bun Choon egg tart, and a stall selling chicken baos. I also highly recommend Batu caves.

1hga91q,"Hey all, I would love to get some advice from you about my current solo trip in Malaysia. First of all, I (38F) want to state that I am an experienced backpacker. I have been on multiple trips lasting from a few weeks to a few years. Mostly solo and more on a chill pace. With that, I learned early on having a plan is nice, but I was never even remotely able to keep that plan. I was spontaneous and followed other travellers recommendations, when I had the feeling we share the same mindset. Hence, I completely gave up on planning entirely. That's for the background, now on to my very privileged problem. Yesterday, I arrived in Kuala Lumpur and I will be flying out of KL in about 3.5 weeks. I have no idea where to go and what to do. I specifically don't know where I should spend new years. I would like to hava a social chill place for NYE, not much of a big party. Do any of you know of a place? Based on that I think I could work out a rough itinerary. I was thinking about - Ipoh 1-2 days, - Penang 3-5 days, - Langkawi 3-5 days. And depending on how much time I have left, maybe either to Ko Lipe, or Cameron Highlands and Melaka. What do you think? Or shall I just head to Cambodia/Laos üòÇ?",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
m2hmijw,Melaka was my favorite town in Malaysia. Also the perhentian islands are really nice.,positive,positive,0.9766,positive,0.999
m2hq1hs,"I guess that depends on what you like to do! Do you want partying, history, nature, beaches, culture, socializing...? **Kuala Lumpur** is very urban. It has a little bit of history, but it's mainly for nightlife, shopping, partying. If you're looking for glamour and instagram pictures, take KL. **Ipoh** is an industrial city. It's trying to establish itself as a ""hidden gem"" now, but it's still a bit rough. But that has its charm, if you're the type that likes to look behind the stage. Also, lots of pretty temples. **Penang** is the hip city. Multicultural, fusion food, street art, you know. Good place if you enjoy socializing or feel you have an artist's soul. They have some beaches and temples and those are nice, but most people just go for the general vibe. **Langkawi** is tropical resorts. Same applies to **Koh Lipe,** or the **Perhentian** islands (on the other side of the country): beaches, palm trees, sun, sea. Langkawi has the advantage over the other two that it's a pretty big island, so there are more adventurous activities (waterfalls, mountains, mangroves) to be found if you get bored of the beach. **Malacca** is somewhat similar to Penang, but it focuses a bit more on (old) history than on contemporary culture. Colonial architecture, forts, good food. **Cameron Highlands** are mainly nice because of how different they are to the rest of the country, suddenly going from hot and palm plantations to cold and evergreens. Very touristy, though (and more older tourists or families). Good for a day trip to see the tea, or for longer if you just want to relax, maybe hike a bit. Definitely not an ""active"" social spot. You didn't mention **Taman Negara**, which is the closest you'll get to wild nature. Even there it's a sanitized version of nature (you won't be allowed to go far from the entrance), unless you go on a multi-day tour. It's still pretty cool, but maybe the middle of the jungle is not the best place to spend NYE. You also didn't mention **Singapore**, which, fair enough, it's not Malaysia, but a lot of people go there anyway because why not.",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0
m2huenc,"I spent about 2 weeks in Malaysia (side quest to Singapore) as a solo woman in my early 30s in early 2020. I can't remember exactly how long I spent in each place but it went something like this: KL: 2-3 nights. I enjoyed it but its not my favourite SEA city Malacca: 2 nights. Great food and unique colonial architecture. Lots of temples, mosques, and churches to visit. A cute and very walkable place. Singapore: 3 nights. This wasn't part of my original loose plan, but by chance an old friend was there. 3 nights for me in SG was probably enough, but I'm glad I went and got to experience it. Its more expensive than Malaysia. Cameron Highlands: 3 nights. Very scenic with hiking, big views and tea plantations. I liked the slow pace, sociable hostels, and cooler temperatures Ipoh: 1 night. The food markets were good and it was nice to visit somewhere less touristy. I didn't visit any temples so one night was plenty for me. Agree with another poster that it was quite industrial. The bus station is outside the city so factor this in. Georgetown: c5 nights. At this point I specifically wanted to stay longer somewhere longer, plus it was lunar new year. Brilliant food, temples interesting architecture, and plenty to see and do for several nights at a slow pace, I didn't visit beaches. If I'd not gone to SG I was going to go to Taman Negara and I regret that I didn't get the chance to go. If I'd had more time I would have also gone to Borneo Malaysia for the wildlife or Perhentian Islands. I wasn't so bothered about beaches as it was part of a longer trip and I knew I'd have plenty of opportunity. I mostly took night buses and they were some of the best I've been on.

Here is my list: **üáªüá≥ Da Nang ‚Äì 9.5/10** * Growing digital nomad community * Very affordable * Beautiful beach and chill vibes * More English speakers than other Vietnamese cities * Grab bikes come within 5 minutes; very quick to travel between areas * Ideal weather is in winter * good air quality. * Felt very safe * I heard summer is very hot and humid but the beaches are swimmable. In winter you can't swim * The best massages and very affordable * Very limited nightlife, kinda ghost town at midnight * Mostly just Vietnamese and Korean food options * Probably the kindest people I‚Äôve met in SEA * Very close to Hoi An **üá≤üáæ Penang ‚Äì 9/10** * Rich in culture and heritage * Beautiful beaches and near scenic islands * Weather is hot af during the day but evenings are nice * Humidity was bearable * Good air quality * Safe city * Beaches stay full of people at night and they always have some fun activities * Not much to do if you wanna party * Feels family oriented; this could be either good or bad * Well-developed infrastructure * Food heaven: Indian, Chinese, and Arabic * Slightly pricey for long stays over a month $$$ **üá≤üáæ Kuala Lumpur (KL) ‚Äì 7.5/10** * Very modern and well-connected * Most people speak English * Great food variety * Pricy for long stays * Very diverse city; sometimes people thought I'm local * Advanced healthcare * Hard to find decent apartments that isn't moldy or has humidity issues * Malls everywhere * Gyms are very expensive for some reason * Okay nightlife, nothing crazy and alcohol is expensive * Malaysian, Chinese, Indian, western, Middle Eastern food options. The Malaysian food is the cheapest but usually fried and oily. * Didn't need to worry much about haggling * Train that connects most hotspots; I mostly used it over Grab * Easy to meet people and young professionals * Downsides: super humid, chaotic energy, not much chill space, not walkable city * Also the only city where I experienced racism or hostility in customer service situations, happened more than once. **üáπüá≠ Bangkok ‚Äì 8/10** * Never boring, nightlife and entertainment 24/7 * Great food scene (local + Western) * Cool roof bars * Thai massages everywhere, but I still prefer the Vietnamese oil massages * There are many tourists and the city is too crowded everywhere * Diverse city: China town, Korean town (Sukhumvit Plaza), Soi Arab. * Easy to meet new people or go on dates because there are many solo travellers * English was not an issue * Super humid and hot even at night; I showered 3 times every day * Bad traffic if you use Grab but they got a train * Need to know how and when to haggle. Best to book things online. * The best malls * Scams here and there, gotta watch out if you are alone * Need to watch out for your valuable items if you go clubbing or bars * Worst air pollution on this list * Healthcare is good * Affordable massages and personal care (Spa, skincare, etc) * A fun place short-term but I wouldn't stay long **üáªüá≥ Hanoi ‚Äì 6.5/10** * Culturally rich and close to stunning nature * City itself isn‚Äôt super developed * Lots of touristy attractions to explore solo or with group tours (very affordable) * Sidewalks are taken over by motorbikes and crossing the streets ain't fun, least walkable city I ever been to * Easy to meet new people but hard to make friends due to language barrier and most travellers just stay a few days and leave * Not the cleanest streets but the shops are mostly clean and nice from inside * Bad air quality, I wore a face mask * Dating apps full of scammers and sex workers based on quick glance and stories I read * Food, especially meat from street food, is not always clean... all my homies got food poisoning * Very few English speakers * Got overrun with disrespectful tourists (loud party people, Karens, etc.) * Very Affordable * Amazing nature if you explore the country side * Great nightlife * Peak cafes * Very limited food options, if you wanna something else other than Vietnamese",positive,positive,1.0,positive,1.0

Digital nomads aren't exactly the most attractive tenants, since they'll be staying in Malaysia for a **maximum** of 12 months, which is what the country's digital nomad visa allows them.

Secondly, the Malaysian government approved only 2,000 digital nomad visas between 2022 and 2024 (out of 4,000 applications). \[1\] That implies 1,000 digital nomads a year.

And the prices for all that are only slightly higher than in Europe ‚Äì nothing like the absurdity in Turkey where a 100g pack of prosciutto can cost ‚Ç¨15-20.

mnxpnrc,"I am ethnically Chinese from KL. Like KL is my hometown. I feel a lot of the stuff said here about discrimination against non Malays and non Muslims is overstated. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, it's just way more nuanced than people are letting on here. They kind of sound like they heard about someone's bad experience and have generalized their impression of Malaysia to be like apartheid South Africa or something. It's not. I've also lived in Canada for 5 years, and the discrimination I experienced there was much worse than anything I've experienced in Malaysia. There are also a ton of foreigners in KL from South Asia, China, the rest of ASEAN, and Africa. You'll see those groups stick together often, but then, why wouldn't they? Like is there an expectation that they're supposed to all act out those scenes from ""diverse college ads"" or something? I do admit that Malaysian landlords have a despicable tendency to ask about race, but that's easily avoided if you go through AirBnb and that sort of thing. If you're renting in KL, like close to downtown, I highly doubt they ask about race. It depends on the neighbourhood. Then again, all of this is subjective, and it very much depends on area and social class. The more upper class, the more you start seeing different races mixing together. It's the middle and lower classes where there's more division. And obviously, the more suburban, or the more rural you get, the more obvious it might be too. But you're talking about KL, so. I think KL is well liked by many people, especially older travellers (30s and above) and people with families, because it's more orderly and clean than other Southeast Asian cities except Singapore. It still has a dash of culture and chaos if you know where to look. It's very much a case of, if you want Michelin starred dining in some fancy revolving sky tower bullshit you can get it. If you want to eat street food made out of suspicious meat on a rat infested street where some guy is hollering about his religion's end times you can get that too. If you move to KL, you'll experience a higher and more globalized standard of living. But that may not be what you want. My biggest recommendation for having a nice time in KL is getting in touch with locals and having them show you the proper spots.

It's a modern city and while there are more traditional areas with wooden houses and remnants of British colonial architecture, the vibe isn't as relaxed as Bangkok or even Hanoi (I didn't find Hanoi that relaxing, to be honest). It's the only place where I was asked what race I was when I was trying to rent a place. That was the kicker for me. As a woman I didn't feel that safe and I had to resort to my RBF, which I hate doing, especially coming from relaxed places like Thailand and Cambodia where men leave you alone. I like walking around and many times I find myself being the only non local. In KL once or twice I felt uncomfortable being the only woman amongst many men. I'm also petite, so that doesn't help. It's a good city, but I found it dull and I don't drink/use drugs/party, so imagine how dull it might be for someone who does. As a country Malaysia isn't as culturally open as it professes to be. A friend who's lived there for years told me what the Malays really think of the Chinese and the Indians and it's not good. In 6 weeks in Malaysia I only counted maybe 4 or 5 mixed race couples?

mg1yxkl,"G'day g'day! FULL disclosure, I haven‚Äôt personally relocated to Singapore, Malaysia, or the UAE. And I‚Äôm an Aussie. But! I AM a digital nomad interested in this space, and I'm currently writing a comprehensive 'Survival to Success guide for Nomads hailing from the most common countries nomads hail from - and Canada happens to be one of them. THe taxes, visas, and cost of living (COL) stuff is obviously a very important consideration for nomads, and the information I‚Äôll lay out here applies to you as a Candian, but... always DYOR! The visa and tax space is highly maleable because the digital nomad scene ius growing as people leave their country of origin in pursuit of locations more aligned with their values and their hip pockets. With this all disclosed, here's what I've found so far‚Ä¶ Singapore personal income tax is low relative to Canada‚Äôs. Progressive rates max out around 22%.. This said, most earners fall into much lower brackets and you should check your brackets to see how this will apply to you (obviously. Also, nevcer hurts to consult a tax specialist. Tax is tricky and it makes sense to check what your liabilities are). When in doubt, DYOR ! Cost of Living is high, particularly rent, which is one of the biggest problems for relocaters depending on your income. If you want to live in central areas, expect premium prices. Food can also get expensive if you rely on dining out in more Western-style places, but food/hawker stalls are affordable, as with a lot of Asian city locations. Work visas inj singapore like the employment pass are competitive, and Singapore has been tightening criteria lately, especially around minimum salaries. They seem to be hiring locals first, more and more, too, which may box out folks like yourself. There are some visa options for entrepreneurs, but they come with high income or investment requirements and the figures can be a bit offputting. Coudn‚Äôt tell you what they are off the top of my dome, though. Basically, Singapore doesn't seem like an especially friendly freelancer visa destination based on my research. Malaysia....Personal income tax ranges from 0%-30%, more or less. But expats with no Malaysian-sourced income can sometimes structure their affairs to limit taxes. Again, the cost to you in the long run if you see a tax specialist is high and well worth the investment. Heads up: foreign income is currently tax-exempt, though this could change. And it really could - the tax and visa situation for any given country is evolving really quickly, so continue to DYOR and stay abreast of changes. COL in Malyasia is way lower than in Singapore. Rent, food, transport are all relatively more affordable. Even in Kuala Lumpur you can find modern apartments for a fraction of what you‚Äôd pay in the West, which is enticing (to someone like me). Visa Process is easier compared to Singapore,too. Check out the my second home (MM2H) visa. It‚Äôs been revamped a few times recently, though, so again, stay abreast of its status relative to your intentions and circumstances. Also, if you‚Äôre working remotely for non-Malaysian clients, Malaysia is pretty digital nomad-friendly‚Ä¶ even though they don‚Äôt have an official DN visa yet. Work visas through employers exist, but they‚Äôre more for traditional employment, which may or may not fit your bill. UAE - the tax situation is one of the UAE‚Äôs biggest draws - 0% personal income tax for individuals. Some VAT (value added tax - get used to hearing this if you‚Äôre thinking of moving around a bit because it‚Äôs important!) applies to goods and services, but income itself is untaxed. I've been looking into this for myself, but cultutally I'm not sure it's what I'm looking for as a destination. COL in UAE varies massively based on how you choose to live and spend. Rent in Dubai and Abu Dhabi can be steep, but if you live in less central areas or neighboring emirates (like Sharjah), you can expect to save some coin. Groceries tend to be pricier, especially imported items (consider your favourite Canadian staples, say), but local food is reasonable. Re visas‚Ä¶the UAE seems to be trying to entice nomads with their nomad-friendly Remote Work Visa, which lets you live in Dubai while working for an overseas employer. They also offer freelance visas in soime sectors, like media, tech, design etc. You‚Äôd need to deep diove more to see whether this visa satisfies your circumstances, though. The visa process is fairly streamlined, compared to some countries, though there are fees! ‚Ä¶And there are defs some mandatory health insurance requirements you;d need to meet in order to be eligible. Hope this helps. And cheers for the prompted revision deep dive - it helps with the ebook! Happy DYOR-ing, and hit me up if you're interested in checking out my ebook when it becomes available!

I've been looking at Thailand, Philippines, and Malaysia, but open to other suggestions. Here's the thing: * **Budget:** I have about $5,000 in savings. I considered Dubai but it is too expensive with the upfront yearly rent. * **Gear:** I have a decent amount of tech gear (mics, cameras, powerful computer) that I need to bring. * **Visa Runs:** Not a fan of constant visa runs, but open to it if it's the best option. Any advice on good visa options for my situation? Also, any recommendations for countries with: * Easier company setup (if that helps with visas) * Affordable monthly living costs * Good internet and coworking spaces Thanks in advance for any help!",positive,positive,0.9833,positive,0.9997
lwxs8q7,"With all due respect but i don‚Äôt think $5000 in savings will get you a digital nomad visa. You would be better off taking a tourist visa for 3 months and do border runs although many people on Facebook have shared that they are being denied entry as immigration in South-East Asia is cracking down on this. The Thai DTV asks for 500.000 baht on your bank account which is about $14,360 and the Thai Digital Nomad visa is the cheapest and easiest one to get at the moment. If you want to extend that visa, that amount still needs to be on your bank account which means that you can‚Äôt touch it or you need to add to it before extending. Nobody actually cares about how long you have been employed, they only look at remote working permission from your employer which needs to be stipulated in your work contract. Permanent residency is difficult to get outside of Europe. Excuse me if i am not aware of any other visas but from the ones in South-East Asia, this is what I know. The visa itself has a different price in every currency but it‚Äôs ¬£300 for the UK and also $300 for the US I believe but some have paid the equivalent of $400. It‚Äôs valid for 5 years and you can only stay 180 per year (6 months) before you need to leave and re-enter for another 180 days and you can continue doing this for 5 years. You only have one option to stay a full year by extending the 180 days for another 180 days which you are only allowed to do once during your 5 year visa. Again, you will have to submit all details and proof of funds again when you do this and pay the visa extension fee.",positive,positive,0.7558,positive,0.9905

There are reasons for this (non-justifiable) that I think a lot others here have shared, but the bottom line is basically owners want to make things easy for them and agents don't really have any incentives to change that mindset. Despite being a Malaysian, I run the risk of getting discriminated as well. What I normally do is I try to lead with my best foot forward i.e being transparent about my pay and job. I also try to build that rapport with the agent, so they will be more confident in vouching for me. If it is not this unit, there will be others. If I'm not wrong, what typically happens is agent might not share your profile to owners who only prefers a certain race. However, its not the race that they are necessarily concerned with but rather certain aspects like can you afford to pay, will you pay on time, will you keep the house clean or will you be doing illegal activities. If you can convince the agent that you're good on this front, they might be willing to vouch for you. After all, the sooner they can close the listing, the faster they will get paid and can move on to the next. Another option, one that I have not tried is to reach out to folks from your country or in you case perhaps continent. They might be able to hook you up with their agent (who probably have much better experiences with Africans) or some might even be agents themselves. I'm sure you can find these communities on FB. You can also try foreign agents in general, but I would think they might charge you a premium. Not sure but can try and compare prices.

We‚Äôre seriously considering moving to Kuala Lumpur for the long haul‚Äîthink settling down, buying property, and eventually retiring there. We‚Äôre also planning to bring our parents to live with us. Malaysia‚Äôs MM2H (Malaysia My Second Home) program looks appealing for this, and we‚Äôre ready to invest in a home in KL. Here‚Äôs our situation: * We‚Äôre both out to our families, and they‚Äôre fully supportive of our relationship. * We‚Äôre also looking to run an international trade business, so a strong English-speaking environment is a big plus for us. * We want a place where we can live comfortably as a gay couple, even if we‚Äôre not super loud about it‚Äîjust a peaceful, practical life. * We‚Äôve been comparing Kuala Lumpur with Bangkok, actually. Thailand is obviously more progressive‚Äîsame-sex marriage is legal, and it‚Äôs super gay-friendly. But the downside is that English isn‚Äôt as widely spoken there, which could be tricky for our business and day-to-day life. Malaysia, on the other hand, has a much stronger English-speaking culture, which we love, but we‚Äôre unsure about how welcoming it is for a gay couple long-term. We‚Äôre feeling pretty torn. KL ticks a lot of boxes for us‚Äîaffordable living, good infrastructure, English usage‚Äîbut we‚Äôre worried about how our relationship might be perceived or if it could cause issues down the line. We don‚Äôt need a rainbow-flag-waving scene; we‚Äôre just a regular couple in our 40s looking to settle down and grow old together. So, what do you think? Is KL a realistic option for us? Any expats, locals, or others with experience living there as part of the LGBTQ+ community who can weigh in? How‚Äôs life in KL for a gay couple who‚Äôs low-key but still wants to feel at home?

On the ground, I was pretty much forced to learn street malay if I wanted to get exactly what I need (unless you just intend to buy Western products from the mall, but then even Bangkok would fill the same need, I'd think). It's always hard to advice a fellow Americans to move here because I don't know how careful you wish to be and what sort of freedom you actually expect. It's possible to do drugs, be gay, be promiscuous and a lot of other stuffs that are formally legally forbidden, but you need to be smart and discrete about it. It will have to stay at home pretty much entirely. Would you be ready to lie that your husband is ""just a friend"", if asked, or have no affectionate contact in public (not even holding hands)? If yes, then nobody will specifically go after you. Plenty of men and women walk the street in pair, and nobody says anything (in KL itself you can even see locals who are clearly ""together"", but they still never show being a couple in any final way). Likely nothing would happen in the street, because people would assume you're tourists (you can expect a few gawkers, but no violence in busy urban areas), but your neighbors might be ""weirded out"" if you explicitly told them, unless they lived abroad. Some people on reddit will tell you it's ""**completely** fine"", but that's because that's the world they want to live in, not the world they actually live in. I prefer to give you the uglier, but probably closer to the truth, version. Why not come and visit and see if it's comfy first? If it's too oppressive, you'll know within a week I think.

However, it is still classified as a developing or upper-middle-income country by organizations like the World Bank. Several factors contribute to this classification: 1. Income Distribution and Inequality: While Malaysia has a relatively high GDP per capita, there is still significant income inequality. The income gap between urban and rural populations, as well as among different ethnic groups, poses challenges for the nation‚Äôs development status. 2. Economic Dependence on Natural Resources: Malaysia‚Äôs economy is heavily dependent on natural resources, such as palm oil, petroleum, and natural gas. This reliance can make the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices, potentially affecting long-term economic stability. 3. Innovation and High-Value Industries: Although Malaysia has a strong manufacturing sector, much of it focuses on assembly rather than high-value or high-tech innovation. Moving toward a knowledge-based economy with advanced technology sectors can be essential for achieving developed status. 4. Education Quality and Workforce Skills: The education system in Malaysia has improved, but there are gaps in quality and access, particularly in rural areas. For a country to be considered developed, a highly skilled and innovative workforce is often crucial. 5. Social and Institutional Reforms: Developed countries typically have strong institutions and governance structures. Malaysia still faces challenges related to corruption, regulatory efficiency, and policy transparency, which can hinder further progress toward a developed status. 6. Sustainability and Environmental Concerns: Developed nations increasingly focus on sustainable development. Malaysia has made strides, but it faces challenges balancing economic growth with environmental protection, such as deforestation, urban pollution, and biodiversity preservation. Achieving developed nation status often involves reforms that promote a more inclusive economy, diversification beyond resources, and enhancing innovation, sustainability, and governance.

For the first six months, the tax rate deducted from your salary is 30%. You can only get this back when filing your tax return, which, if you start in 2025, you might receive by April 2026. Transportation and quality of life ‚Äì Public transportation here is much better than in Metro Manila, so you won‚Äôt have trouble getting around. The cost of essential goods (food, toiletries, etc.) is 20%-30% cheaper when converted to pesos. For example, if a BigMac in the Philippines costs Php 250.00, it‚Äôs only about Php 200.00 here in KL when converted to Philippine Peso Cost of living ‚Äì It‚Äôs cheaper here compared to the Philippines. In the Philippines, you can rent a solo condo room (with shared areas for cooking, laundry, and dining) for about Php 12k - Php 15k, whereas in KL, you can get a similar setup for about Php 6.5k - Php 9k. Security and crime rate ‚Äì In Metro Manila, almost everything is a danger zone, except for places like BGC (sometimes). In KL, there are only a few areas that are considered dangerous. You also don‚Äôt have to be afraid to pull out your phone because snatchers and robbers are rare. Metro Manila has become so unsafe lately that it‚Äôs sometimes scary to go outside. Recreational activities ‚Äì KL has many green spaces for a capital city. There are plenty of public parks and open spaces to relax during weekends or when you‚Äôre bored at home. There are still many trees here, even though it‚Äôs considered a city. In Metro Manila, there‚Äôs hardly any open green space‚ÄîDiliman is the only one I can think of. Overall: The cost of living for a Filipino professional who isn‚Äôt extravagant or lavish is around Php 18,000 - Php 22,000 per month when converted to pesos. I also earned Php 40,000 when I was in the Philippines. Salary is one thing, but quality of life is another. Back then, I‚Äôd wake up at 5:30 am to avoid traffic on EDSA for my 9 am work.

micdmz2,"Dirty carnivore here. I consume a lot of beef in my diet, say maybe 80% of the time. And with this I lost shit tons of weight... But anyways Wagyu = Japanese cow There's pure blood = 100% Japanese cow and there's crossbred wagyu ie. bred with other breeds like Holstein or Hartford etc Anywhere you go you can get both types of Wagyu In Japan, crossbred are labeled as F1 etc. Pure blood starts with an A In Australia if they don't specify the type (ie. Pure blood wagyu) then they're crossbred. There are world famous Australian farms that produces award winning pure bloods like Blackmore or Mayura.. major difference is that Australian regulation forces the farms to allow the cows to roam free vs kept locked in cages like in Japan.. therefore pureblood Australian cows do not grow as big as the Japanese ones lah (just like active vs sedentary folks) Same goes with American farms.. Different country uses different grading for their beef.. Japan uses F and A, Australia uses MB (wagyu are normally MB4 and above), America calls them choice, select, prime (prime is typically MB5 and above) and there is no designation beyond prime Grades are assigned after slaughter.. based on yield (size) and intermuscular fat (marbling).. Ribeye from a grass fed Limousine cow (like the ones in Malaysia) are small, maybe a couple of inches in diameter vs an A5 Ribeye, which can get as big as my face üòÖ Universally the MB grading can be applied to all beef.. Japan goes all the way up to MB12 (A5) Australian pureblood goes up to MB9+ American Prime goes up to MB5+ Types of cuts Chicken have dark and white meat.. when you go to KFC in the US for example, they'll ask if you want white or dark.. white = no moving muscles (ie. Breast), dark are moving muscles (ie. Wings, thighs, drumsticks) Scientifically white and dark meat should be cooked at different temperatures to pastureze and break down the connective tissue. But the differences between white and dark meat in chicken is minor When it comes to beef and lamb etc.. the differences are amplified. Instead of labelling them as white or dark meat, the difference muscles are split between steak cuts and roast/braised/bbq cuts Steak cuts are the muscles where you can cook hot and fast on a pan, grill, etc. Because cows are on all fours, these are the muscles along their spine (from front: chuck, ribeye, splits into striploin/NY strip and tenderloin/batang pinang). These are also called prime cuts There are secondary ""steak"" cuts like the rump or sirloin. Not as tender but you can cook them hot and fast. The roast/braised/bbq cuts required a long cook process at low heat (braised in oven, slow roast/bbq/smoke). Ribs, briskets, topsides..these are tough muscles even if they have beautiful marbling.. Americans like their steaks nice and thick.. thick steaks or big roast/bbq.. different parts of Americas favors different cuts.. Texas briskets, Florida Tri Tips, Brasil/Argentina Picanha.. Japanese/Koreans tend to slice them thin (even tough cuts like kalbi, tongue, karubi etc when cut thin then doesn't feel tough) Some people prefer thick steaks with a bit of a bite, some prefer lean, some prefer fatty, some prefers tender.. And just like anything else, the price of the cuts are based on market forces: supply and demand.. famous cuts like ribeye, NY, tenderloin, porterhouse, Tomahawk are well recognized cuts, most restaurants sell them, demand high, price are high lah BBQ cuts like ribs, briskets a lot more technical to cook.. higher cost to cook even though cheaper to buy raw, but restaurants charge a lot of money.. so price 2x5 like steak cuts in restaurants And then there are underrated cuts like Petite Tender, Flat Iron, Memphis, Picanha etc which are wayyyyy cheaper compared to it's Prime cuts equivalent Typical markups for steaks/BBQ in Malaysia is 600% and hugher.. but if you buy them in bulk direct from supplier (like me) then they are wayyy cheaper.. keep in mind that grocery stores already mark up the raw beef they sell there by approx 100% so you can save a lot of money by buying bulk, as long as you meet their MOQ üòÖ",positive,negative,0.5361,positive,0.9987

There all all kinds of vending machines with various drinks- for some reason all the teas I got were bland and bitter.
