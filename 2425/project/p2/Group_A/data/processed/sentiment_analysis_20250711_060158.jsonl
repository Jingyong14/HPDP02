{"id": "m38q1g6", "title": "Comment on: A note on self-promotion and commercial activities...", "content": "Subject: Urgent Advice Needed - Tenant vs Owner Rights Hi everyone, I need urgent advice. I am currently renting a condominium near Ampang Park. I signed a tenancy agreement in September 2024 through an agent who claimed to represent the owner (who lives in China). The agreement was signed by the “owner” and stamped by LHDN. The agent provided their own bank details for rent and deposit payments, claiming they were the owner’s representative in Malaysia. I negotiated a deal to pay a full year’s rent in advance, along with the deposit, and made the payment by November 2024. However, in December 2024, I was contacted by a new agent claiming to represent the owner. They said the owner never received any money and that the previous agent forged the agreement. The owner also reached out to me, confirming this claim and saying they never signed the agreement. Now, the owner’s wife has contacted me, asking my family to leave the unit because they never received the rental payments.

{"id": "lqf0mz1", "title": "Comment on: I cycled across Mongolia. Here are some pics. ...", "content": "I’m currently on an indefinite round-the-world bicycle tour, and spent two months this summer bikepacking Mongolia & wanted to share some thoughts and photos. Mongolia is definitely not a place you want to come to unprepared, especially if you want to venture further inland rather than just following the handful of asphalt roads. Only 20% of roads in the country are paved! So get yourself some wide tires and know how to repair your bike - it’s unlikely to come across a bikestore in the countryside of the least densely populated country in the world 😉 I spent majority of my time in the Altai Mountains in the far west of the country, where most locals are actually ethnically Kazakh. Since Mongolia was never part of the Soviet Union, the Kazakhs here actually managed to preserve their culture better than those in modern-day Kazakhstan. Encounters were always nice, you will be offered plenty of Airag (fermented horse milk) and rock-hard cheese. But the food isn’t the reason you come to Mongolia, it’s to experience the way of life of the nomads and to enjoy the nature and remoteness. Those things can be quite challenging at times, not only does it require one to carry food for multiple days, drink water from streams and rivers (bring a good filter!) but it also requires a sturdy tent. I had multiple nights where I had to reinforce my tent wall with my body so it doesn’t collapse, because of super strong winds. I also experienced a snowstorm in June while crossing one of the 3000m passes. One minor mishap I had was when I got a deep cut in my foot because I slipped during a river crossing - luckily I was close to a village but it’s better to have a sufficient first aid kit in case you are in the middle of nowhere. There is also little to no cellphone service outside of the settlements, so an SOS beacon could be a wise investment. In the villages you will find a pharmacy and a couple mini-markets, but don’t always expect restaurants or homestays. These small grocery stores are surprisingly well stocked, in my experience it’s easier to find what you need here than in big cities in China! After over a month in the Altai Mountains I made it to the next “big” city to witness the Naadam, Mongolia’s biggest annual festival.

It was a show that I won’t forget, and you shouldn’t miss if you visit Mongolia during summer. After skipping a few hundred kilometres of the asphalt road through the Gobi desert by bus I cycled another loop in the Khanghai mountains in the centre of the country, where the nature was similarly beautiful and slightly less rugged. It was a bit greener which meant more nomads, and a lot more livestock - yak, sheep, goats and a couple horses. I then continued my way towards Ulaanbaatar, the capital, where I got my Chinese visa for the next adventure- the Tibetan Plateau (where I am now).

Mongolia is definitely not a place you want to come to unprepared, especially if you want to venture further inland rather than just following the handful of asphalt roads. Only 20% of roads in the country are paved! So get yourself some wide tires and know how to repair your bike - it’s unlikely to come across a bikestore in the countryside of the least densely populated country in the world 😉 I spent majority of my time in the Altai Mountains in the far west of the country, where most locals are actually ethnically Kazakh. Since Mongolia was never part of the Soviet Union, the Kazakhs here actually managed to preserve their culture better than those in modern-day Kazakhstan. Encounters were always nice, you will be offered plenty of Airag (fermented horse milk) and rock-hard cheese. But the food isn’t the reason you come to Mongolia, it’s to experience the way of life of the nomads and to enjoy the nature and remoteness. Those things can be quite challenging at times, not only does it require one to carry food for multiple days, drink water from streams and rivers (bring a good filter!) but it also requires a sturdy tent. I had multiple nights where I had to reinforce my tent wall with my body so it doesn’t collapse, because of super strong winds. I also experienced a snowstorm in June while crossing one of the 3000m passes.

{"id": "1kym6kq", "title": "Singapore/Malaysia advice - a night in Malacca or a day trip from KL?", "content": "Hi everyone, I (late 20s) am looking to travel to Singapore/Malaysia with my parents (early 60s) for three weeks, sometime around January to March. My parents sent me an itinerary they liked the look of, and I've adapted it to add a few days where I think we could do with more time. My main question is whether it's worth doing a night in Malacca or whether we should do it as a day trip from KL? This ties in to my questions around getting around. If we went straight to KL, I assume it's easier to fly - but if we stopped for a night in Malacca, would it be best to get coaches or hire a car between there and Penang? I've read it's worth having a car for Cameron Highlands, but not sure where else we'd need it. This is what I've got so far for the itinerary - really appreciate any feedback/thoughts/comments and anything I'm really missing! Thanks!

We know a lot of you come here to share your stuff, from awesome photography, your killer rendang recipe, asking for travel and lodging advice or simply to lepak-lepak and make friends, and that's totally cool! But we also gotta keep things chill and avoid turning the sub into a giant marketplace. We value the diverse range of content shared here, from personal recommendations to stunning photos of our beautiful city. We understand that many users come here to share their experiences, talents, and businesses with the community. However, it's important to maintain a balance between informative content and blatant advertising. ### Self-promotion and commercial activities Moving forward, we will be removing posts that fall under the following categories: * 🐵 **Naked self-promotion**: This includes posts that solely promote a product, service, or personal brand without offering any valuable content or discussion to the community. * 🙈 **Repeated self-promotion**: Consistently promoting the same product or service across multiple posts will be considered spam. * 🙉 **Disguised advertising**: Content that appears informative but ultimately aims to sell a product or service will be removed. * 🙊 **Multi-level marketing (MLM) or pyramid scheme promotions**: These activities are strictly prohibited on our subreddit. ### Acceptable Content and Engagement We encourage users to continue sharing their knowledge, experiences, and recommendations in a way that benefits the community. Here are some examples of acceptable content: * 📷 Sharing high-quality photos or videos of Kuala Lumpur that capture the city's essence and beauty. * 🎋 Posting informative guides or reviews about restaurants, attractions, or events in Kuala Lumpur. * 🎡 Engaging in genuine discussions about life in Kuala Lumpur, offering advice, and asking questions. Now, we're not trying to be party poopers here. We just wanna make sure r/KualaLumpur stays a place where everyone feels welcome to share, learn, and discover new things about our awesome city. So keep posting those drool-worthy food pics, insightful reviews, and hilarious KL memes (we love those!), and let's keep this community thriving!

{"id": "1h0bdyp", "title": "Just got back from China. My experience.", "content": "1. Language Barrier: My Chinese is close to non-existent. I used Duolingo Chinese and practised until I got to the chapter about travelling. SURPRISINGLY, those basic Duolingo phrases and vocabulary from baby level all the way until the chapter on travelling were more than sufficient to survive in China! 2. Alipay: I used Alipay EVERYWHERE. Just add your credit card to it before entering China. 3. Ordering Food in Restaurants: For ordering food in restaurants, I learned how to say this phrase in Chinese well: \"I'm a foreigner. Can I order through you?\" and they will say yes! You can use your translator app and show them the Chinese words too! Some of them spoke into a translator app on their phone or on mine. Either way, everyone was super friendly and patient to help you and translate for you. 4. Flight Booking: I bought some domestic flights through the China Eastern Airlines website. OUTSIDE OF CHINA, I couldn’t pick my seat. It kept saying, \"International flights can't select seat.\" But once I got into China and connected to hotel Wi-Fi, I had absolutely no issues getting to the page to select my seat. So just buy the flight tickets first and once you're in China, visit the website and select your seats. 5. Passport Verification Issues: I had issues verifying passports on other, both in-app and on the website when I was outside of China. Once I got into China, I could verify easily and immediately! :) tripdotcom app and website work with foreign credit cards directly. 6. High-Speed Rail: Taking high-speed rail is insanely easy. Just go to the counter with a human and show them your passport. No communication needed. They know what to do. 7. Attraction Ticketing: All ticketing for attractions is done with your passport. Just bring your passport and go to the human counter. The human will either scan it or find your passport number in their device. They’re very used to foreigners showing up with passports. No communication needed. 8. Group Tours: I joined a few local group tours recommended by my hotel concierge that catered to local Chinese tourists and were all in the Chinese language. These were much cheaper than English tours (which were only private tours). No issues! The tour guides used translator apps to communicate with us, and some even added me on WeChat and sent me all the instructions there. WeChat has a built-in translator, so even if you reply in English, they know how to use it to translate it into Chinese before replying to you. The hilarious part is some other tour members really wanted to communicate with me and know where I'm from, so they added me on WeChat to text chat me during the tour with the in-built translator. 9. Solo Travel: I travelled mostly on my own and only booked day group tours recommended by the hotels after my arrival. I went to Chongqing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Wulong, and Beijing. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. 10. Food on Group Tours: The food the day group tours take you to eat is HORRENDOUS. BUT! The food I found on my own by randomly walking into local shopping malls was superb! So yeah... I guess the group tours need to profit and take you to only places they already had prior arrangements with, which in most cases aren’t great. 11. Street Food: I did not eat any street food, as a number of my friends got food poisoning on a previous trip. Not saying all street food is bad, but I had limited time and didn’t want to spend it being sick. I exclusively ate at restaurants inside shopping malls. 12. Cashless Payments: I used absolutely 0 cash. Alipay worked all the time! Yay! 13. 5G Everywhere: There is 5G like EVERYWHERE. And I mean really EVERYWHERE, even in the deepest mountain tourist attractions! I guess mobile network with strong data is everywhere even in the most remote areas, so people can pay with Alipay haha! 14. Didi for Cabs: Never flagged any cabs from the street. Exclusively used Didi. Absolutely no issues with finding pickup spots, nor communication. Once you're in China, you'll be able to download the Didi Greater China app. It's in English and works flawlessly with English names of places and recommended pickup points so you know where to walk to for waiting for your driver. The Didi Greater China app also works with my foreign credit card directly. 15. SIM Cards and Internet: I didn’t get any local SIM card. I got the Tripdotcom billion connect eSIM that had a VPN built-in. Had strong signal everywhere (see point 13) and was superfast. I even did a number of Zoom video calls in the midst of my trip and had absolutely 0 lag even when I was screen sharing. Hope this is helpful!

You can use your translator app and show them the Chinese words too! Some of them spoke into a translator app on their phone or on mine. Either way, everyone was super friendly and patient to help you and translate for you. 4. Flight Booking: I bought some domestic flights through the China Eastern Airlines website. OUTSIDE OF CHINA, I couldn’t pick my seat. It kept saying, \"International flights can't select seat.\" But once I got into China and connected to hotel Wi-Fi, I had absolutely no issues getting to the page to select my seat. So just buy the flight tickets first and once you're in China, visit the website and select your seats. 5. Passport Verification Issues: I had issues verifying passports on other, both in-app and on the website when I was outside of China. Once I got into China, I could verify easily and immediately! :) tripdotcom app and website work with foreign credit cards directly. 6. High-Speed Rail: Taking high-speed rail is insanely easy. Just go to the counter with a human and show them your passport. No communication needed. They know what to do. 7. Attraction Ticketing: All ticketing for attractions is done with your passport. Just bring your passport and go to the human counter. The human will either scan it or find your passport number in their device. They’re very used to foreigners showing up with passports. No communication needed. 8. Group Tours: I joined a few local group tours recommended by my hotel concierge that catered to local Chinese tourists and were all in the Chinese language. These were much cheaper than English tours (which were only private tours). No issues! The tour guides used translator apps to communicate with us, and some even added me on WeChat and sent me all the instructions there. WeChat has a built-in translator, so even if you reply in English, they know how to use it to translate it into Chinese before replying to you. The hilarious part is some other tour members really wanted to communicate with me and know where I'm from, so they added me on WeChat to text chat me during the tour with the in-built translator. 9. Solo Travel: I travelled mostly on my own and only booked day group tours recommended by the hotels after my arrival. I went to Chongqing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Wulong, and Beijing. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. 10. Food on Group Tours: The food the day group tours take you to eat is HORRENDOUS. BUT! The food I found on my own by randomly walking into local shopping malls was superb! So yeah... I guess the group tours need to profit and take you to only places they already had prior arrangements with, which in most cases aren’t great. 11. Street Food: I did not eat any street food, as a number of my friends got food poisoning on a previous trip. Not saying all street food is bad, but I had limited time and didn’t want to spend it being sick. I exclusively ate at restaurants inside shopping malls. 12. Cashless Payments: I used absolutely 0 cash. Alipay worked all the time! Yay! 13. 5G Everywhere: There is 5G like EVERYWHERE. And I mean really EVERYWHERE, even in the deepest mountain tourist attractions! I guess mobile network with strong data is everywhere even in the most remote areas, so people can pay with Alipay haha! 14. Didi for Cabs: Never flagged any cabs from the street. Exclusively used Didi. Absolutely no issues with finding pickup spots, nor communication. Once you're in China, you'll be able to download the Didi Greater China app. It's in English and works flawlessly with English names of places and recommended pickup points so you know where to walk to for waiting for your driver. The Didi Greater China app also works with my foreign credit card directly. 15. SIM Cards and Internet: I didn’t get any local SIM card. I got the Tripdotcom billion connect eSIM that had a VPN built-in. Had strong signal everywhere (see point 13) and was superfast. I even did a number of Zoom video calls in the midst of my trip and had absolutely 0 lag even when I was screen sharing. Hope this is helpful! Ask me anything!", "cleaned": "1. Language Barrier: My Chinese is close to non-existent. I used Duolingo Chinese and practised until I got to the chapter about travelling. SURPRISINGLY, those basic Duolingo phrases and vocabulary from baby level all the way until the chapter on travelling were more than sufficient to survive in China! 2. Alipay: I used Alipay EVERYWHERE. Just add your credit card to it before entering China. 3. Ordering Food in Restaurants: For ordering food in restaurants, I learned how to say this phrase in Chinese well: \"I'm a foreigner. Can I order through you?\" and they will say yes! You can use your translator app and show them the Chinese words too! Some of them spoke into a translator app on their phone or on mine. Either way, everyone was super friendly and patient to help you and translate for you. 4. Flight Booking: I bought some domestic flights through the China Eastern Airlines website.

In KL, the male to female ratio is extremely noticable to me so far and i’m getting a lot of stares (and I’ve been to India where they’re known to stare… i’m finding it even more uncomfortable and unnerving here in KL). The ratio is bad during the day but even worse at night. I’m not staying out crazy late, even walking back to my hostel from the LRT around 8pm I see no women. I’ve read on reddit that harassment/stares/catcalling by men is common here. One user said it’s the same in George Town and Langkawi. I know Malaysia is known to be safe but the discomfort I have felt is soiling my experience. I was even filmed selfie-mode by a man today and he turned the camera back when I noticed. Thoughts on this issue and has anyone felt the same? Should I expect it to be better once I leave KL or should I cut my losses and head somewhere else? Would cost me ~300CAD to relocate for the remaining 6 days. Not terrible, but i’m a budget backpacker lol. I don’t want to feel this uncomfortable for my whole 10 days here if it won’t change much by location. Going to sleep on it and would appreciate any insight.

{"id": "1dqgrcm", "title": "Things to Keep in Mind While Traveling to Thailand", "content": "Hey fellow travellers, If you're planning a trip to Thailand, you're in for an amazing adventure! Thailand is a beautiful country with vibrant culture, stunning beaches, and delicious food. Here are some essential tips to keep in mind to make your journey smoother and more enjoyable: **1)** **Respect the Local Culture-** Thailand is known for its rich culture and traditions. Always dress modestly when visiting temples and religious sites. It's also important to show respect by removing your shoes before entering someone's home or a sacred place. **2)Use Reliable Transportation-** For long distances, opt for reputable transportation options like trains, buses, or domestic flights. Within cities, consider using metered taxis, Grab (a popular ride-hailing app), or tuk-tuks. Always agree on a fare before starting your ride in a tuk-tuk. **3)Be Cautious with Street Food**:- Thai street food is delicious and a must-try! However, choose vendors that look clean and have a high turnover of food to avoid any stomach issues. Stick to bottled water and avoid ice unless you're sure it's made from filtered water. **4**)**Bargain Politely**:- Markets in Thailand are great places to shop for souvenirs, but bargaining is common. Always negotiate with a smile and be respectful. Remember, it's part of the culture and should be done politely. **5)Learn Basic Thai Phrases-** Learning a few basic Thai phrases like \"hello\" (sawasdee), \"thank you\" (khob khun), and \"excuse me\" (kor tod) can go a long way in showing respect and making local interactions smoother. **6)Keep Your Valuables Safe**:- Petty theft can happen, especially in crowded areas. Use a money belt or a secure bag to keep your valuables safe, and be mindful of your belongings at all times. **7)Stay Aware of Scams**:- Like any popular tourist destination, scams can occur. Be cautious of overly friendly strangers offering deals that seem too good to be true, and always verify information with trusted sources.", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1dqgrcm", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 0, "created_date": "2024-06-28T10:48:47+00:00", "author": "Economy-Seesaw-1161", "subreddit": "asiatravel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/asiatravel/comments/1dqgrcm/things_to_keep_in_mind_while_traveling_to_thailand/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/asiatravel/comments/1dqgrcm/things_to_keep_in_mind_while_traveling_to_thailand/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1981, "flair": null, "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "top", "collection_timestamp": "2025-07-10T22:02:39.584473+00:00", "original_content": "Hey fellow travellers, If you're planning a trip to Thailand, you're in for an amazing adventure!

Here are some essential tips to keep in mind to make your journey smoother and more enjoyable: **1)** **Respect the Local Culture-** Thailand is known for its rich culture and traditions. Always dress modestly when visiting temples and religious sites. It's also important to show respect by removing your shoes before entering someone's home or a sacred place. **2)Use Reliable Transportation-** For long distances, opt for reputable transportation options like trains, buses, or domestic flights. Within cities, consider using metered taxis, Grab (a popular ride-hailing app), or tuk-tuks. Always agree on a fare before starting your ride in a tuk-tuk. **3)Be Cautious with Street Food**:- Thai street food is delicious and a must-try! However, choose vendors that look clean and have a high turnover of food to avoid any stomach issues. Stick to bottled water and avoid ice unless you're sure it's made from filtered water. **4**)**Bargain Politely**:- Markets in Thailand are great places to shop for souvenirs, but bargaining is common. Always negotiate with a smile and be respectful. Remember, it's part of the culture and should be done politely. **5)Learn Basic Thai Phrases-** Learning a few basic Thai phrases like \"hello\" (sawasdee), \"thank you\" (khob khun), and \"excuse me\" (kor tod) can go a long way in showing respect and making local interactions smoother. **6)Keep Your Valuables Safe**:- Petty theft can happen, especially in crowded areas. Use a money belt or a secure bag to keep your valuables safe, and be mindful of your belongings at all times. **7)Stay Aware of Scams**:- Like any popular tourist destination, scams can occur. Be cautious of overly friendly strangers offering deals that seem too good to be true, and always verify information with trusted sources.", "tokens": ["hey", "fellow", "travellers", ",", "if", "you",
