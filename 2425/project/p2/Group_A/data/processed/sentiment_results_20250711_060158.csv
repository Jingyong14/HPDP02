"Comment on: Travelling to Malaysia for 10 Days, Please Help in Itinerary.... Day 2 - Chinatown is closer to the central market. Might as well move it to day 1. Day 3 - I generally need one day for Genting highlands (but it could be just me!) .The queues at GH are long and tiring. Buy express lane tickets to skip queues. I don't see Thean hou temple in your list . It's a beautiful temple and has a calming vibe. Unless it was excluded intentionally, you can include it on day 1 evening. Bukit bintang is overrated - I am still clueless why tourists visit that place. Most IMP : where is PETRONAS towers in your list ? That's the highlight of Malaysia. You cannot miss that !! That should be a must see !!! Just across the twin towers is the salona bridge. It will hardly take 20-30 mins to cover...",chinatown closer central market might well move generally need one genting highland queue long tire buy express lane ticket skip queue see thean hou temple list beautiful temple calm vibe unless exclude intentionally include even bukit bintang overrate still clueless tourist imp petronas tower list highlight miss must see across twin tower salona bridge hardly take min cover saloma bridge,positive,1.0,lstm_model,2025-07-10T22:03:23.505417+00:00
"Comment on: Travelling to Malaysia for 10 Days, Please Help in Itinerary.... For your day1 and day2, just plot it on the google map. And you will find out what makes sense, what does not. And i find that you are doing too much in one go, keep it flexible, dont go crazy coming to malaysia is also about food and culture as well. Are you sure you will enjoy bird park and aquarium both in the same day? Day 3 - no, you dont just simply go to genting highland for half a day. Just skip genting highland. Unless you have a love for theme parks. Go to batu caves and enjoy the other things not covered in day 1 & 2. Day 5 - from KL to ipoh you can take train, however it is usually fully book during weekends. From ipoh to penang island, buses are an option as well but you are travelling during year ...",plot google map find make sense find much one keep flexible dont crazy come food culture well sure enjoy bird park aquarium dont simply genting highland half skip genting highland unless love theme park batu cave enjoy thing cover ipoh take train however usually fully book weekend ipoh island bus option well travel end local want well seriously dont need hill look kek lok enjoy comment part,positive,1.0,lstm_model,2025-07-10T22:03:23.606333+00:00

It's about 2 hours drive between KL and Melaka. That means you are spending 4 hours just on the road. I personally won't enjoy that. Personally I would stay a night in Melaka and explore the place like how you would for Ipoh. But then again, the next day to Ipoh is gonna take much longer. LOL.
